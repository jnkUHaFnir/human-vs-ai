By adding the clipping step, you can prevent the samples from exceeding the valid range of values.

Please note that this approach assumes that the input samples are in the range of -1.0 to 1.0. If your input samples have a different range, you may need to adjust the clipping thresholds accordingly.

Additionally, you may want to experiment with the value of the multiplierStep variable to increase or decrease the gain in smaller or larger increments.
