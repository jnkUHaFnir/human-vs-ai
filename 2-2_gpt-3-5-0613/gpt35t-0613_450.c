Please note that these suggestions may or may not result in significant performance improvements based on the specific use case and the compiler optimizations applied. It's recommended to profile your code to measure the actual impact of these changes. Additionally, using platform-specific functions like `inet_addr` may provide better performance depending on the context and target platform, so you could also explore those options.
