Explanation:
- We allocate 1024 bytes plus 16 additional bytes to ensure that we have enough memory to align it. The extra 16 bytes won't be used by the memset_16aligned function.
- We cast the memory address to a uintptr_t type for easier manipulation.
- We add 15 to the address to ensure that we don't skip any potential 16-byte boundary when aligning it.
- We perform a bitwise AND operation with the complement of 0x0F (which is equivalent to bitmasking the lower 4 bits) to round down the address to the nearest multiple of 16 (i.e., align it to a 16-byte boundary).
- Finally, we cast the aligned address back to void * and store it in ptr for later use.

After executing the memset_16aligned function, we can free the memory allocated using the free function.
