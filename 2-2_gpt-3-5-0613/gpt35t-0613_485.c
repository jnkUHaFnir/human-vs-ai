In this code, when the lexer matches the regular expression `^.*` (which matches the entire line), it switches to the `COPYLINE` start condition. In this start condition, the lexer simply discards everything until it matches a newline character and then switches back to the initial start condition.

This approach avoids using `REJECT` and repeatedly backtracking one character at a time. Instead, it switches to a different start condition where it simply discards characters until it finds a newline.

This method should be more efficient, as it avoids unnecessary backtracking and allows the lexer to skip over the entire line in one step.
