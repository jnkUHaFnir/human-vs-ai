This code starts with an initial buffer size of 100 characters and reads input line by line until the string "END" is entered. It dynamically allocates more memory as needed using `new` to double the buffer size whenever the current input exceeds the buffer size.

Once the input is finished, the accumulated address input is copied to the final `address` variable using `strcpy`. Finally, the `address` variable is printed, and the dynamically allocated memory is freed using `delete[]`.
