With this approach:

- The `append_line` function dynamically manages a buffer that holds the current line's contents. It reallocates the buffer as necessary when new text extends beyond the current capacity.
- The `clear_line` function resets the buffer after we're done with the current line.
- The `line` variable holds the entire input line and can be accessed when an error is encountered.
- There's no use of `REJECT`, which improves efficiency.

This way, you have the offending line readily available in the `line` buffer whenever you need to print it along with the caret indicating the error position.

Remember to free the `line` buffer when it is no longer needed or when your program terminates to prevent memory leaks. This cleanup code should be placed in an appropriate location, such as at the end of the lexing process or in a function that is called when the program terminates.
