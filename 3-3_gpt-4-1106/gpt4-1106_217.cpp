This `%typemap(freearg)` tells SWIG to execute the `delete[] $1;` statement to clean up the memory when the argument is no longer needed (e.g., after the function call that used the `uint8_t *` parameter is completed).

Additionally, if `ByteBuffer` is supposed to own the buffer, you would implement a destructor for `ByteBuffer` in your C++ code that releases the buffer, and ensure that the SWIG wrapper calls it correctly:

```cpp
struct ByteBuffer
{
    int length;
    uint8_t *dataBuf;

    ByteBuffer() : length(0), dataBuf(nullptr) {}
    ~ByteBuffer() {
        delete[] dataBuf;
    }
};
struct ByteBuffer {
    int length;
    uint8_t *dataBuf;
    
    ByteBuffer(int len, uint8_t* buf) : length(len), dataBuf(buf) {}
};

In this case, the memory is allocated on the Python side, and you only pass a pointer to the C++ side. The buffer will be deallocated once the bytearray and its views go out of scope and are garbage-collected.

Remember that you'll have to modify your SWIG interface file accordingly to handle `PyByteArray` or `PyMemoryView`.

Finally, you've mentioned that you're using Python 3.5, which has reached its end of life. It is advisable to update to a more recent version of Python for better performance and security if possible. Similarly, SWIG has also had several updates since version 3.0.7, and using a newer version may also provide improvements and bug fixes.
