A couple of important things to note in the Python code:

1. `input_bytes` is encoded from a Python string to bytes since C requires bytes-like objects.
2. `argtypes` for `c_convert_to_16` are specified so that ctypes knows what types to expect when the function is called.

Lastly, remember to deal with the allocated memory properly in your C code; the Python wrapper doesn't automatically free it. You might need to create another C function to deallocate memory, which you can call from Python after you're done using the returned string. Or alternatively, rely on the automatic memory management of Python and ensure your C function returns an internal static buffer instead; however, this would make the function non-reentrant and not thread-safe.
