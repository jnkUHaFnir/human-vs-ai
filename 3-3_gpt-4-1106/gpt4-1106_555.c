This code snippet does the following:
1. Enumerates all top-level windows with the class name "CabinetWClass" which corresponds to Windows Explorer windows.
2. For each Explorer window found, it enumerates child windows to find those that are instances of "SysListView32", which corresponds to the file view in Explorer.
3. Retrieves the window text (the window's title, usually the folder path) to check if it contains the path to your USB drive.
4. If a window is showing content from the USB drive, it sends a `WM_CLOSE` message to that window, causing it to close.

This approach will not force-close applications that are actively using files or folders on the drive, but it should close Explorer windows viewing the drive's contents.

Please be aware that forcibly closing windows in this way can lead to data loss if the user has unsaved changes or ongoing file operations. Always advise users to ensure any active file operations are completed and changes are saved before ejecting the drive.
