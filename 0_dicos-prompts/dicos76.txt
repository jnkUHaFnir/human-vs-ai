void read_entries() {
  int count = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < top; i++) {
    FILE *fp;
    fp = fopen(File_List[i], "r");
    char buff[1024];

    while (fgets(buff, 1024, fp) != NULL) {
      if (good_data(buff)) {
        count++;
      }

    }

    fclose(fp);
  }
}


int good_data(char* buff) {
      char *ip;
      ip = strtok (buff, " ");
      ip = strtok (NULL, " ");
      ip = strtok (NULL, " ");
      ip = strtok (ip, ":");

      printf("IP below\n");
      printf("%s\n", ip);
      //strcmp(ip, "69.12.26.238");
      return 0;
}

I have this function that's parsing a line and grabbing the ip out of it.  When I do the following it prints exactly as I expect.  But if I try to pass that ip to a function I get a segmentation fault.  Even by having a function below my printf line causes the printf to print null for the value of ip.  How is that possible? What can I do to be able to use the ip value?
