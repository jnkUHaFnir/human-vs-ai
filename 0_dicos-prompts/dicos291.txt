I want to validate user input, making sure they enter only regular characters (combination of 0-9, A-Z, and a-z).
This is what I have, but its matching strings like "adsifj%a%%dosif". Which I do not want. It wont match if those invalid characters were at the beginning. How can I fix this?
int main(){
char name[128];

int match = scanf(" %[0-9a-zA-Z^\n]", name); 
printf("%d", match);    

if (match == 1){
    printf("Matched");
}else{
    printf("Invalid");
}
return 0;

}
