So I have this code here:
std::cout << "Here's Question 2 now for " << char(156) << "200" << endl;
Sleep(2000);

PlaySound(TEXT("Millionaire/£100Play.wav"), NULL, SND_FILENAME | SND_ASYNC | SND_LOOP);
std::cout << "In maths, which of these numbers is not referred to as a square number?" << endl;
Sleep(2000);
std::cout << "A: 0" << endl;
Sleep(2000);
std::cout << "B: 1" << endl;
Sleep(2000);
std::cout << "C: 2" << endl;
Sleep(2000);
std::cout << "D: 4" << endl;
Sleep(2000);

answerQues2:    
        std::cout << "So, A, B, C or D?";
        std::cin >> answer2;

if (answer2 == "C" || answer2 == "c")
    {
        std::cout << "That's correct, you've won " << char(156) << "200!" << endl;
        PlaySound(TEXT("Millionaire/£100correct.wav"), NULL, SND_FILENAME);
        Sleep(2000);
    }

Now, the code itself is not the problem. What this is essentially is a quiz with a question and then 4 answers (A, B, C and D). Now in order to actually make up more questions, you'd have to go into the code itself and go through a lengthy process to edit everything. I want to make a text file that you can edit the questions and answers inside the text file, hence replacing everything in the code (So for example, if I wanted to change Q1, I could open the text file, replace the question and when I load up the program, the question will be changed). How would I be able to do this?
