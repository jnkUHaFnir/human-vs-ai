I am trying to read a textfile like this
    1234567890 1234
    9876543210 22

into a List struct in my program. I read in the files via fgets() and then use strtok to seperate the numbers, put them into variables and then finally into the List. However, I find that in doing this and printing the resulting strings, strtok always takes the final string in the final line to be NULL, thus resulting in a segmentation fault.
fgets(fileOutput,400,filePointer); //Read in a line from the file

inputPlate = strtok(fileOutput," "); // Take the first token, store     into inputPlate

while(fileOutput != NULL)
{
    string = strtok(NULL," ");
    mileage = atoi(string); //Convert from string to integer and store into mileage

    car = initializeCar(mileage,dateNULL,inputPlate);
    avail->next = addList(avail->next,car,0);

    fgets(fileOutput,400,filePointer);
    inputPlate = strtok(fileOutput," ");
} 

How do I resolve this?
