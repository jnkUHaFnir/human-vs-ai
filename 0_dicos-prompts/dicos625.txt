I am trying to copy a char from a char type function to a var in the main function using strcpy, but the program always give me a random value as return and the program is finished. Is there some syntax error I'm missing in the code or maybe another way to do this copy?
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>

char text()
{
    char palavra1[]= "tata";
    return palavra1;
}

char main()
{
    char saida[50];
    strcpy(saida,text());   // this line is supposed to copy the string from text to the var saida
    printf("%s", saida);
    return 0;
}
