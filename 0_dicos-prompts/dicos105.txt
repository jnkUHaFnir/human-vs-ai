I'm working in c++, so I started to make a system that open a sentence in a 2d array of chars. After I trying hard to solve problems with it, I got it working, but not in the way it was supposed.
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

void backword(char* input, char* output[])
{
    for(int i = 0, c = 0; strlen(input)>i; i++)
    {
        if(input[i] == ' ')
        {
            c++;
            i++;
        }
        output[c] += input[i];
    }
    cout << output[1]; //debug
}

int main()
{
    char** output = new char*[30];
    backword("dfs sdfsdfsd dsffsdf", output);
    cout << output[1]; //dubug
    return 0;
}

So whats the issue?: It don't show anything, after my debug it seems my array is not changed
More details:This code I tried in visual studio, not working, tried in Code::Blocks, same result. Initially was intended to return a pointer char**, but I started with this method, and I didn't got any compile errors.
P.S:Sorry if it's a dumb mistake, but I didn't work with chars in this way before.
Thank you.
