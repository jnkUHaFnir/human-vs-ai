Im trying to get it to stop but im not quite sure how to do that. Im just starting to learn it. I want it to stop when I type -99.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
this is what I have: 
#include <stdio.h>
#define SIZE 5
int main(void)
{
    int hot=0, pleasant=0, cold=0;
    int sum=0, i, temp;
    double average;

    for(i=0; i<SIZE; i++)
    {
        printf("Enter temperature %d> (-99 to stop)",i+1);
        scanf("%d",&temp);
        sum +=temp;

         if(temp >= 85)
        {
            ++hot;
        }

        else if(temp >= 60 && temp <= 84)
        {
            ++pleasant;
        }

        else
        {
            ++cold;
        }
    }
    average = (double) sum/SIZE;

    printf("The Collection of hot days is %d\n",hot);
    printf("The Collection of pleasant days is %d\n",pleasant);
    printf("The Collection of cold days is %d\n",cold);
    printf("The Average temperature is %.2f\n",average);
    return(0);
}
