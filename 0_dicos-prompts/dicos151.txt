typedef struct node{
    char word[20];
    struct node * next;
}node;

int main(){
    FILE *ifp;
    char newword[20];
    node * head;

    ifp = fopen("para.txt","r");
    head = (node * )malloc(sizeof(node));

    while(fscanf(ifp,"%s",newword) != EOF){
         head -> next = NULL;
         head -> word = newword;
     }

    return 0;
}

I want to add the words which is read by the text file to a link list. I tried to do with this code but I couldn't. How can I fix this.
