I am trying to write a simple program for a practice problem, written below:

(Sales-Commission Calculator) One large chemical company pays its salespeople on a com-
mission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of chemicals in a week receives $200 plus 9% of
$5000, or a total of $650. Develop a program that will input each salesperson’s gross sales for last
week and will calculate and display that salesperson’s earnings. Process one salesperson's figures at a
time.

I am trying to handle if the user inputs things other than numbers, e.g. strings/char. But, when I try running it and test it by inputting a string/char, it keeps on looping until VSC crashes.
My code:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void){
    float sales = 0;
    float salary = 0;

    while (sales != -1)
    {
        printf("Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): ");
        scanf("%f", &sales);

        while ((sales != -1) && !(sales >= 0))
        {
            puts("Input error, please try again");
            fflush(stdin);
            printf("Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): ");
            scanf("%f", &sales);
        }

        if (sales != -1)
        {
            salary = 200 + (0.09 * sales);

            printf("Salary is: $%.2f\n", salary);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

I used a similar approach in another program and it works just fine, so I don't know what the problem is here.
The code of the other program:
while(!(collected >= 0))
{
    fflush(stdin);
    puts("Input error, please try again.");
    printf("Enter total amount collected (-1 to quit): $");
    scanf("%f", &collected);
}

An explanation would be highly appreciated!
