I am writing a program in C, and I am reading a text file using fread and I cannot read correctly integers. 
The value of a in the text file is 16, the output I get is:
 a= 538976288

I have used an analogous code that read successfully binary files. I would like to learn what is the best way to read ASCII tables in c.
The table size is given by the integers on the top of the file. The data are separated by spaces.
This is the simple code I wrote:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int a, flag_fread;
  FILE * p_finput = NULL;
  char * filename = NULL;

  filename = malloc(sizeof(char) * (strlen(argv[1]) + 1));
  strncpy(filename, argv[1],strlen(argv[1]));
  filename[strlen(argv[1])] = '\0';

  p_finput = fopen(filename, "r");
  if (p_finput == NULL)
    {
      printf("couldn't open %s \n", filename);
      abort();
    }


  flag_fread = fread(&(a), sizeof(int), 1, p_finput);

  printf("a= %d \n", a);  

  fclose(p_finput);
  free(filename);
  return 0;
}
