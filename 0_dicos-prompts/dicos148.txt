The purpose of the program is to read a text file that contains a list of 55 authors and titles of books. The format of the list goes (author name, booktitle). I can use malloc, strlen, strtok, and strcopy. So far I got the program to read out the names of the authors but I am stuck on how to get the program to read the titles of the books.How would I get the program to read the titles of the books from the text file? I know that there are errors in this code so please be kind .  
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

void loadBookName(char* filename, char* authorName[55], char* bookName[55]);

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  //Create two arrays each with length 55
  char* authorName[55];
  char* bookName[55];

  //Ask the user for the name of the file
  char fileName[30];
  //Insert your code here
  printf("Please enter the name of the file\n");
  scanf("%s", fileName);

  //Call the method loadBookName
  loadBookName(fileName, authorName, bookName);

return 0;

//Print the two arrays to test if the two arrays were correctly loaded with the data
int i = 0;
printf("%-30s%-40s\n", "Author", "Book");
for (i = 0; i < 55; i++) {
    printf("%-30s%-40s\n", authorName[i], bookName[i]);
}

}

   /*
  loadBookName method
  This method is responsible for:
   1. Take a file containing a book name and the author name as input
   2. Open the file       
   3. Read the information in the file and store it in two arrays: authorName, bookName
   4. Return the two arrays to the main method.
   */
  void loadBookName(char* filename, char* authorName[55], char* bookName[55])
  {
   int i;
   char string_array[80];
   const char comma[2] = ",";
   //Open the file
   FILE *fp;
   fp = fopen(filename, "r");
   if (fp == NULL)
   {
       printf("Failed to open file\n");
       exit(1);
   }

   for (i=0; i<55; i++)
      {
       fgets(string_array, 80, fp);
       authorName[i] = strtok(string_array, comma);
       printf("%s\n", *authorName);
      }





      //Close the file
      fclose(fp);
      }

when I run the program in terminal it asks me to enter the filename (books.txt). Then when I enter the file name, the program prints a list of 55 authors.
