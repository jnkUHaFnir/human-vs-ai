The task is to sort a list in alphabetical order. That is to be done by changing the pointer variables and not just switching the content of the nodes.
I first wanted to implemend a swap function. that function shall swap 2 nodes. After that I wanted to implement a sorting algorithm. My problem is, that the swaping function does not really work as it should and the algorithm doesnt either (ofc, since the swapping function doesnt even work).
    struct student {
      char Vorname[51];
      char Nachname[51];
      int MatNr;
      char Adresse[51];
      int Kurse;
      struct student *next;
      struct student *previous;
    };

    struct student *first = NULL;
    struct student *last = NULL;  

    void swap(struct student *pointer) {
      struct student *pointer1, *pointer3, *pointer4;
      pointer1 = pointer->previous;
      pointer3 = pointer->next;
      pointer4 = pointer->next->next;

      pointer4->previous = pointer;
      pointer->next = pointer4;
      pointer1->next = pointer3;
      pointer3->previous = pointer1;
      pointer->previous = pointer3;
      pointer3->next = pointer;
    }

This is the not finished sort function. I didnt implement it correctly yet, since the swap function took my attention first.
void sort(void) {
  struct student *pointer1, *pointer2, *pointer3, *pointer4;
  pointer1 = first->previous;
  pointer2 = pointer1->next;
  pointer3 = pointer2->next;
  pointer4 = pointer3->next;

  while(pointer2 != NULL){
    if((strcmp(pointer2->Nachname, pointer3->Nachname)) > 0) {
           swap(pointer2);
    }
    pointer1 = pointer1->next;
    printList();
  }
}  

When I run swap(first); the first element doesnt get displayed since the pointer first is now pointing at the second node. Well, thats easily done with first = pointer3;
When I run swap(first->next); there is a similar problem, since it also leaves out one node of the list.
I'm not really sure how to get this function right, since first shouldnt get involved in swapping the 2nd and 3rd node of the list.
I'd appreciate any help that could help me solving this, maybe I'm just overlooking some minor mistake, but I can't really get the solution of this.
Thank you!
