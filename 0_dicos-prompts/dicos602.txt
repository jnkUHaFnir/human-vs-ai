I need to read white space separated words from stdin, then use an emalloc function to allocate memory for each word as it is read in.
I am finding this very confusing, here is what I have written so far.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main (void)
{
    #define SIZE 100
    char* username[100]; 
    int i;
    int p;

    /* Read words into array */
    for(i = 0; i < 100; i++)
    {
        username[i] = calloc(SIZE, sizeof(char)); 
        scanf("%s",username[i]);
    }

    /* Print out array */
    for (p = 0; p < 100; p++) {
        printf("%s", username[p]);
    }

    return 0;
}

I am not sure whether I am reading words in correctly using scanf and I am pretty sure my memory allocation is not quite correct. Coming from Java, memory allocation is tricky to wrap my mind around. How come I do not include an & infront of username[i] in the scanf function?
