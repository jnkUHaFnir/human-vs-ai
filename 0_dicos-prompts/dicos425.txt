Using the following code:
char *name = malloc(sizeof(char) + 256); 

printf("What is your name? ");
scanf("%s", name);

printf("Hello %s. Nice to meet you.\n", name);

A user can enter their name but when they enter a name with a space like Lucas Aardvark, scanf() just cuts off everything after Lucas. How do I make scanf() allow spaces
