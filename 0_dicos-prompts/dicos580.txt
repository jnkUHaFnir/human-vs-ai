My problem is such that I need to read string from file. File example:

Example 1 sentence
Example sentence number xd 595 xd 49 lol

but I have to read only the string part, not numbers. I guess I have to use fscanf() with %s for it but let me know what you guys think about it.
The part where my problem begins is how to read the string (it is unknown length) using malloc(), realloc()? I tried it by myself, but I failed (my solution is at bottom of my post).
Then I need to show the result on the screen.
P.S. I have to use malloc()/calloc(), realloc() <-- it has to be dynamically allocated string :) (char *)
Code I've tried:
    int wordSize = 2;
    char *word = (char *)malloc(wordSize*sizeof(char));
    char ch;

    FILE* InputWords = NULL;
    InputWords = fopen(ListOfWords,"r"); /* variable ListOfWords contains name of the file */

    if (InputWords == NULL)
    {
      printf("Error while opening the file.\n");
      return 0;
    }

    int index = 0;
    while((ch = fgetc(InputWords)) != -1)
    {
      if(ch == ' ')
      {
        printf("%s\n", word);
        wordSize = 2;
        index = 0;
        free(word);
        char* word = (char *)malloc(wordSize*sizeof(char));
      }
      else
      {
        wordSize++;
        word = (char *)realloc(word, wordSize*sizeof(char));
        strcpy(word,ch);
        index++;
      }
    }
  fclose(InputWords);
