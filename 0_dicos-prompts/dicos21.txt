I have a structure as below:
struct Query {  
    int     pages[];
    int     currentpage;
};

I was wondering if it was possible to set the size of this array after creating the structure.
Query new = malloc(sizeof(struct Query));

After this, I will perform some calculations which will then  tell me the size that pages[] needs to be. If pages[] needed to be of size 4, how can I set it as such?
