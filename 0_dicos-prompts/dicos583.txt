I'm struggling with rearranging my array. I have used from single to multiple loops trying to put spaces (white characters) between two pairs of characters, but I was constantly rewriting the original input. So there is always an input of even length, for example ABCDEFGH. And my task would be to extend the size of the array by putting spaces after every 2 chars (except the last one). 
So the output would be:
AB CD EF GH

So the size of output (if I'm correct) will be (2*input_len)-1
Thanks.
EDIT: 
This is my code so far
// output = "ABCDEFGHIJKL
char c1;
  char c2;
  char c3;
  int o_len = strlen(output);
  for(int i = 2; i < o_len + olen/2; i = i + 3){
    if(i == 2){
      c1 = output[i];
      c2 = output[i+1];
      c3 = output[i+2];
      output[i] = ' ';
      output[i+1] = c1;
      output[i+2] = c2;
    }
    else{
      c1 = output[i];
      c2 = output[i+1];
      output[i] = ' ';
      output[i+1] = c3;
      output[i+2] = c1;
      c3 = c2;
    }
  }

So the first 3 pairs are printed correctly, then it is all a mess.
