// Processes the array, starting from the second element
    int j, k;
    char *doubled;
    for (j = 1; j < 500; j++) {
        strcpy(doubled, output[j]);
        strcat(doubled, doubled);
        for (k = 0; k < j; k++) {
            if (strcmp(output[k], output[j]) == 0) {
                output[j] = doubled;
            }
            if (strcmp(output[k], doubled) == 0) {
                output[j] = '\0';

    }

Trying to process an array of strings, where whenever a particular string occurs twice, the second occurrence print the duplication of the string (e.g. dog dog ---> dog dogdog), and if there are more than 2 occurrences of a string, delete the string (e.g. dog dog dog ---> dog dogdog).
I have tried to debug and I found that the problem is in this block of code, where I kept getting segmentation fault reports.
What do I have to do to fix this? I have looked at several solutions to strcat() creating segmentation faults, but it seemed none of them really worked.
