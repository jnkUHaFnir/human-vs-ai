I wrote a program that scans an unknown amount of integers into an array but when I run it, it print the last value it has gotten an infinite amount of times.
For example for the input: 1 2 3 4 5
The output would be 55555555555555555555555...
Why does this happen and how can I fix that?
My goal here is to create a array, for an instance {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and then print what it scanned into the array, ONLY ONCE...
int *pSet = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int)); int i; int c;
printf("Please enter a stream of numbers to make a set out of them: ");
printf("\n");

scanf("%d", &c);
pSet[0] = c;
printf("%d ", c);
for(i = 1; c != EOF; i++) {
    pSet = (int*) realloc(pSet, sizeof(int)*(i+1));
    if(pSet == NULL) {
        return FAIL;        
    }
    scanf("%d", &c);
    pSet[i] = c;
    printf("%d ", c);
}

free(pSet);
