Hi I was told during my first class about arrays in C that you cannot declare them using a variable, for example: int array[n]. Yet if I write a code like this:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int array[n];
}

Codeblocks doesn't give me any warning or error. How do I know that what I wrote isn't correct?
