Is there a way in C to store the whole command line options and arguments in a single string. I mean if my command line is ./a.out -n 67 89 78 -i 9 then a string str should be able to print the whole command line. Now, what I am able to do is to print values in different vector forms.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <getopt.h>
#include <string.h>


int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
 int opt;

for(i=0;i<argc;i++){
printf("whole argv was %s\n", argv[i]);
}

while((opt = getopt(argc, argv, "n:i")) != -1) {
switch (opt){
    case 'n':
             printf("i was %s\n", optarg);
             break;

    case 'i':
             printf("i was %s\n", optarg);
             break;
      }
   }
  return 0;
 }

I want this, as optarg only is printing my first argument and I want all the arguments to be printed, so I want to parse it after storing it in string.
