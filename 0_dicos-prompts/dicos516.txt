The concept if very simple. The computer must repeat the question till it recieves a valid response. Here is my current code:
#include <stdio.h>


int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
int age;

do{
printf("How old are you?\n");
scanf("%d", &age);


if (age == 32767)

{
    printf("Error, retry: \n");
}

else
{
    printf("Cool.");
    break;

}
}
while(age!=3267);

return (0);
}

The if else statement is to catch the exception incase the user types something that is not an integer.
I tried using a do-while loop but it ended up as an infinite loop
I used the do-while loop because I needed to go through that procedure until I get a valid age value.
My output with the current code is:
How old are you?
g
Error, retry: 
How old are you?
Error, retry: 
How old are you?
Error, retry: 
How old are you?
Error, retry: 

It goes like this indefinitely.
It would be great if you could help me out.
