I want to split a char array into tokens using the NUL char as the separator.
I have a char array that I've received over the network from a recv command, so I know the length of the char array.  In that char array there are bunch of strings that are separated by the NUL char (\0).  
Because the separator is the NUL char, that means I can't use strtok, because it uses NULL for its own purposes.
So I want to iterate through all the strings starting from byte 8 (the strings are preceded by 2 32 bit integers).
I was thinking I could iterate though all the characters looking for the \0 character and then doing a memcpy of the length I have found so far, but I figured there must be a nicer method than this.
What other approach can I take?
