I have a problem with reading the numbers. After I run the program everything is fine but there are no numbers in the array. I have tried different ways of writing the numbers in the file with no result.
FILE *myFile;
myFile = fopen("numbers.txt", "r");
if (myFile==NULL)
{
    printf("Error Reading File\n");
}
else
{
tek=0;
for (i=0;i++)
{
//  tek=fgetc(myFile);
    fscanf(myFile,"%d",&tek);
    if (tek!=EOF)
    {
        redica[i]=tek;
    }
    else
    {
        break;
    }
}
getch();
