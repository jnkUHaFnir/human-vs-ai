I am writing an operating system in C. I have a basic file system using structs. I am writing a command line, and I want a function to create a new file. I have one set up, but it does not work. The struct initializes fine, but it is not added into the folder.
Each file is a struct of the file type below:
typedef struct {
    char** content; // Address of the text in the file
    char* name;     // Filename
    size_t size;    // Included from stddef.h - set by the function
} file;

Each directory is a struct of the dir type below:
typedef struct {
    file* files[256]; // The files in the directory
    char* name;       // The directory name
    size_t index;     // The index of the next file - basically the length of the files array - starts at 0
} dir;

My new_file function is as follows:
void new(dir* folder, char* name, char* content) { 
    // Folder is a dir* so we can modify the actual struct, not a copy
    file f;
    f.name = name;
    f.content = &content;
    folder -> files[folder -> index] = &f;
    folder -> index++;
}

I am a beginner at C, but I cannot tell what the problem is. Please help!
More Info
The new function (basically):
void new(char* name, char* content, dir* folder) {
    file new = new_file(name, content);
    add_file(folder, new);
}

The add_file function:
void add_file(dir* folder, file f) {
    folder -> files[folder -> dirnum] = f;
    folder -> dirnum++;
}

The function I call to try and read the file:
char* read(dir* folder, char* name) {
    file f = find_file(*folder, name);
    return f.content;
}

With find_file being:
file find_file(folder, name) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < folder.filenum; i++) {
        file f = *folder.files[i];
        if (strcmp(f.name, name, '\0')) {
            return f;
        }
    }
}

And strcmp being a string comparison function I wrote.
After some modifications of the source code, the following bug occurs.
When you run (in the command line):
new hi file // Same as new("hi", "file", &root)
open hi // Same as read(&root, "hi")

The output is open hi.
When I run the new function, folder.files[0] exists. However, folder.files[0] -> name equals gâ†’. Any idea why?
