I've written a function in C to get the size of the terminal:
int get_terminal_size()
{
    struct winsize w;
    ioctl(STDOUT_FILENO, TIOCGWINSZ, &w);

    return w.ws_row * w.ws_col;
}

However, I want to use it as the size parameter when initialising an array in a struct:
struct level
{
    [...]
    char level_data[get_terminal_size()];
}

However, this doesn't compile, as the compiler tells me that the initialiser element needs to be constant (which makes sense, but assigning the return value to a const int doesn't work either).
Is there any other way of doing what I need to do in C?
Thanks in advance.
