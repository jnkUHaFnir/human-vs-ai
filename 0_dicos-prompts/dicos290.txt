So I have this bit of code
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    char *vendas[1];
    int size = 1;
    int current = 0;
    char buffer[50];
    char *token;
    FILE *fp = fopen("Vendas_1M.txt", "r");

    while(fgets(buffer, 50, fp)) {
        token = strtok(buffer, "\n");
        if (size == current) {
            *vendas = realloc(*vendas, sizeof(vendas[0]) * size * 2);
            size *= 2;
        }
        vendas[current] = strdup(token);
        printf("%d - %d - %s\n", current, size, vendas[current]);
        current++;
    }
}

Here's the thing... Using GDB it's giving a segmentation fault on 
vendas[current] = strdup(token);

but the weirdest thing is it works up until the size it at 1024. The size grows up to 1024 and then it just spits a segmentation fault at around the 1200 element. 
I know the problem is on the memory reallocation, because it worked when I had a static array. Just can't figure out what.
