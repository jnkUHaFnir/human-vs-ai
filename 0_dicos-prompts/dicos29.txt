If I open a file handle, but the function encounters other error which is not file error,  before closing the handle, would the file handle be leaked?
FILE* fp = fopen("test.txt", "r");
if (other_condition) {
    perror("other error occurred!");
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
}

How to use C to implement RAII template?
