I've created a program to determine largest number, but my lecturer says it isn't perfect, can anybody make it perfect?
 #include <stdio.h>
 int main () {
     double a,b=0,n, i;
     printf("limit of n input: ");
     scanf ("%lf",&n);

     for (i=1;i<=n;i++) {
         scanf("%lf",&a);
         if (a>b) b=a;
     }

     printf("%.2lf", b);

     return 0;
 }
