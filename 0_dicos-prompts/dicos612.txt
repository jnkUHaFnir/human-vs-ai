This is a homework assignment for my C Programming class.
I am given a text file, with two data columns; the first column is the age; the second column is the avgprice. I'm able to read and print the values fine. However, for some reason the age and avgprice are flipped in the output. I have no clue why.
Here is the code
#include "stdafx.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

double age, avgprice; //age = 1st column, avgprice = 2nd column
FILE *corolla; //ptr for file
char eof; //needed for end of file check

corolla = fopen("C:/Users/Nate/Downloads/DataFiles/corolla.txt", "r");
if (corolla == NULL) { //makes sure the file exists
    printf("File does not exist!\n");
    return 0; //prevents crashing
}
else {
    printf("Age \t\t Average Price\n"); //header for data when printed
    /*prints values until we're at the end of the file*/
    while (fscanf(corolla, "%c", &eof) != EOF) {
        fscanf(corolla, "%lf %lf", &age, &avgprice); //scans in data from file
        printf("%.1f \t\t $%.2f\n", age, avgprice); //prints data from file
    }
}
fclose(corolla); //closes file
return 0;
}

This is what the output looks like

It's puzzling to me because I have used this exact format to do the same thing with other data files--no issues. For some reason, this one file is having difficulty.
Here is the datafile I'm supposed to be reading. I've uploaded it to my Dropbox that way you can inspect the formatting if necessary. Corolla.txt
