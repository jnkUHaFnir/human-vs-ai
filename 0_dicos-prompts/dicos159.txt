So I have something cast as an int, and from my understanding maximum value for an int is 32676, and any value above this will be truncated in C.
If my program has the user inputting data, how can I check if this data can be fully stored in an int, because if it is not I need to tell the user to reinput the data.
For example, if the user tries to put in 450000, I need to tell them to re-input the data, however, a simple comparison seems to truncate the value first before comparing it to INT_MAX?
