So I have this exercise where I need to show the N first prime numbers, but I need to specifically create a function to know if the number is a prime number
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int prime(int num){
    int cont,i,j=0,b;

    b=num;

    do{
        j++;
        i=0;
        for(cont=1;cont<j;cont++){
            if(j%cont == 0)
                i++;
        }
        if(i == 1){
            return(j);
            c=j;
            b--;
        }
    } while (b > 0);
}

int main(){
    int *v,n,cont;

    do{
        printf("Input an integer: ");
        scanf("%d",&n);
    } while (n <= 0);

    v = (int *)malloc(n *  sizeof(int));    

    for(cont=0;cont<n;cont++){
        v[cont] = prime(n);
    }


    for(cont=0;cont<n;cont++){
        printf("%d ",v[cont]);
    }

}

The problem with the way i've done this is that the variable J is aways being set to 0 when i call the function again, i've tried to set something like c=j so when the program return to the prime function it would have the 'previous' j value but it gets a weird random number. So I wanted to know if is there a way to 'return' the result in the main function to the prime function, i couldn't find anything that helped me, not that i could understand at least
