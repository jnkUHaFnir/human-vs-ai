I was trying to implement Viterbi decoder in C. 
So I thought of using a 2-dimensional array which i wanted to create dynamically. Here is the sample code for 2D array created dynamically:
place_table = (int **)malloc((no_places+1)*sizeof(int *));

for(i = 1; i <= no_places; i++)
    place_table[i] = (int *)malloc((no_places+1)*sizeof(int));

The size of this 2-dimensional array keeps on varying in my decoder, i.e., no_places keeps on varying, so I wanted to know how to reallocate memory for the 2-dimensional array. 
Any suggestion or help would be greatly appreciated.
