I have a FILE * from a pipe (popen), and I wanna pass it to char *artist.
The size of information that will be in the FILE is unknown, so it should use malloc().
FILE *tmp1;
char *artist;
tmp1 = popen("cmus-remote -Q | grep 'tag artist' | sed s/'tag artist'/''/g | sed '1s/^.//'", "r");

How can I do this?
