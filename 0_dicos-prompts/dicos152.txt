Big picture: I have a module with functions and a module with procedures and functions over those functions.
When I combine two functions (from function's module interface):
double f1(double alpha, double x);
double f2(double beta, double x);

In several ways, (one of them is adding):
double OP_Addition(double (*f)(double,double) , double (*g)(double,double), double param1, double param2, double x);

Gives no problem with the following (piece of) implementation:
z1 = (*f)(param1, x);
z2 = (*g)(param2, x);
y = z1 + z2;
return y;

But when I want to return a pointer to a "new" function, something like:
void *OP_PAdd( double (*f)(double,double), double param3 );

I can not get it to work properly, neither make the right "call". I want to have use the output "function" as input in other functions.
