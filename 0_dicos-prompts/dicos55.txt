I am using user input to fill a 2d array. A user inputs numbers in one line and I then use nested loops to fill the array like so:
//User inputs: "1 2 3 4 5"

for(i = 0; i < r; i++){
    for(j = 0; j < c; j++){
            scanf("%d", &arr[i][j]);
    }
 }

However, the problem is if the user enters 5 ints when there is room for 6, it just waits for another input. How can I detect if there are insufficient numbers?
I have tried using this but it didn't work:
for(i = 0; i < r; i++){
    for(j = 0; j < c; j++){
        if (!feof(stdin)){
            scanf("%d", &arr[i][j]);
        }
        else{
            printf("insufficient datapoints\n");
        }
    }
 }
