While coding for server-client program using c in linux, I need to append pid of the client process to the fifo filename(fifo file which will be used to send the data back to the client). (The concept of the sever-client program is for server to read the data from the client, compute the data, and send the data back to client for it to display it.) I wish to do this for multiple clients and single server. This way I will be able to have different fifo files for every execution of client file. And to achieve this I need the server to append the pid of client process to the fifo file name.(for eg. if the fifo file name is 'myfifo' and the pid of client is '2891' the resultant fifo filename should be 'myfifo2891')Can anyone help me achieve this? How do I append the pid to the fifo file name? I am thinking of using a structure for it.
