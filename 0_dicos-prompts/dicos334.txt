I'm trying to read in a text file that's a 10x5 matrix of student ID#s and grades. I have a Chromebook. I've downloaded the file (grades.txt) and it's in downloads. I didn't save it anywhere else. I don't know how to fopen and read it. I eventually have to create another column for the average student score, etc. So far, I've got this:
int main();

FILE* spTemp

spTemp = fopen("??", "r");

How can I read the text file?
