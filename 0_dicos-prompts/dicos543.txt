I have the following code and I haven't worked in C for years and I'm confused by the syntax. How could I initialize two patrons within the init function? I assume I need to do some sizeof/malloc magic but really I'm confused on the syntax.
I believe I can access patron data like this:
t->seating[0].first_name 

However, I cannot get the dang array of seating created. Yes, my init function is empty as I've deleted all the crazy code I tried.
#include <stdio.h>

struct patron {
   char last_name[30];
   char first_name[30];
};

struct theatre_seating {
    struct patron **seating;
};

void init(int elem, struct theatre_seating *t);


int main() {
    struct theatre_seating theatre_seating;

    int elem = 2;


    init(elem, &theatre_seating);

    return 1;
}

void init(int elem, struct theatre_seating *t) {

}
