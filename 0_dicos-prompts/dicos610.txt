This program does the following:

Scans a string of text char input[15];
Compares it to char password[ ] = "1sure";
Loops if the strings do not match.
Terminates if the strings match.

The program loops while the strings do not match. However, I also want the program to loop if nothing is input and the user simply presses enter. I tried using an isgraph function but this causes the program to crash. I commented that section out in the code. Can someone suggest how to get the program to loop if there is no input?
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char password[] = "1sure";
    char input[15];

    do
    {
        printf("Password: ");
        scanf("%s", input);

        if(strcmp(password,input)==0)
        {
            printf("Password accepted.");
            putchar('\n');
            return(0);
        }
        /*else if(isgraph(input)==0)
        {
            printf("No input detected."); //Program crashes with this segment.
            continue;
        }*/
        else
        {
            printf("\nInvalid password.\n");
            continue;
        }
    }
    while(1);
}
