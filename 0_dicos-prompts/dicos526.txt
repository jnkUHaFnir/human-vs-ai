I have the following structure
typedef struct _person {
    int age;
    char sex;
    char name[];
}person;

I have done some basic internet search (but unsuccessful) on how to create an instance and initialize a structure with a flexible array member without using malloc().
For example: for normal structures like 
struct a {
    int age; 
    int sex;
};

We can create an instance of struct a and initialize it like
struct a p1 = {10, 'm'};

But for structures with flexible array in it (like _person as mentioned above) how can we create an instance and initialize like how we do it for normal structures?
Is it even possible? If so, how do we pass the array size during the initialization and the actual value to be initialized?
(or) 
Is it true that the only way to create a structure with flexible array is using malloc() as mentioned in C99 specification - 6.7.2.1 Structure and union specifiers - point #17?!
