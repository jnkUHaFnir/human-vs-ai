I want to malloc an integer pointer present inside a structure. 
If in future I need to expand the array, I use realloc.
something like this:
typedef struct {
   int *temp,count
}foo;

main()
{
    foo *fake = (foo*)malloc(1*sizeof(foo));
    fake.count = 0;

    ++(fake.count);
    fake.temp = (int*)malloc((fake.count)*sizeof(int));

    /* I do something */

    /*now i want to realloc "temp" to ++(fake.count) */

Is this way of doing that correct?
    ++(fake.count);
    fake.temp = (int*)realloc(fake.temp,(fake.count)*sizeof(int));
