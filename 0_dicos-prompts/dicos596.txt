I'm new to C, and trying to understand why the following works with a fixed-size character array but not with a pointer:
float number = 1245.12;

// allocate a character array for the buffer
char number_as_string[50];
sprintf(number_as_string, "%f", number);

But allocating a pointer (which I thought would point to a location in memory, and allow iterating to the next memory point, etc.) would not work:
float number = 1245.12;

// allocate a pointer
char * number_as_string;
sprintf(number_as_string, "%f", number);
