I am building a small program that takes name and age as input (stored in a struct) and spits out the output. One of the problems that I am facing is I have to enter the number of people I am going to store, something that I am sure I can solve with realloc() it's just not working. Here is what I got so far.
#include <stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

struct info
{
    int age;
    char name[30];
};

int main()
{
    struct info *Ptr;
    int i, num;

    printf("Enter number of people");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    // Allocates the memory for num structures with pointer Ptr pointing to the base address.
    Ptr = (struct info*)malloc(num * sizeof(struct info));

    for(i = 0; i < num; ++i)
    {
        printf("Enter name and age:\n");
        scanf("%s %d", &(Ptr+i)->name, &(Ptr+i)->age);
    }


    for(i = 0; i < num ; ++i)
        printf("Name = %s, Age = %d\n", (Ptr+i)->name, (Ptr+i)->age);

    return 0;
}

I have tried to realloc inside the first for loop, but it wasn't working even if it makes sense to have it there. Have also tried to convert the loop to a while loop like this:
     while(input != "stop)
    {
      allocate more memory
}

How can I use realloc to in order to skip having to enter the persons number before entering them?
