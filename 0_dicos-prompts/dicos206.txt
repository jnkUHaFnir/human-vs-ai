Might not be the most efficient way, but is it correct and portable?  
int are_overlapping(const char *a, const char *b) {
  return (a + strlen(a) == b + strlen(b));
}

To clarify: what I'm looking for is overlap in memory, not in the actual content. For example:  
const char a[] = "string";
const char b[] = "another string";
are_overlapping(a, b); // should return 0
are_overlapping(a, a + 3); // should return 1
