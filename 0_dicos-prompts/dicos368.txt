I am trying to write a code in C (gcc) to accept only floating numbers with decimals and reject integers, special characters, alphanumeric entry. 
Valid entries are: 
1.23, 3.45, 6.77

Invalid entries:
abc, e34, 834ww, 6, 9,

and some blah things that is not a float. 
This is what I have tried: 
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{    
    double floatnum;
    double decpart=0.000000;
    printf("Enter a floating number num: ");

    while (decpart == 0.0000000)
    {
         scanf("%lf", &floatnum);
         int intpart = (int)floatnum;
         double decpart = floatnum - intpart;
         if (decpart == 0.000000){
             printf("Invalid floating point number, enter again: ");
         }
         else
         {
             printf("Number entered = %.2f\n", floatnum);
             break;
         } 
    }
    return 0;
}

I don't want exact code, but I need some pointers/clues on what would be the best way to achieve that.
