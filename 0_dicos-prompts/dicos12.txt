I am trying to save each line of a text file into an array.
They way I am doing it and works fine so far is this :
char *lines[40];
char line[50];
int i = 0 ;
char* eof ;
while( (eof = fgets(line, 50, in)) != NULL )
{
    lines[i] = strdup(eof); /*Fills the array with line of the txt file one by one*/
    i++;
}

My text file has 40 lines , which I am accessing with a for loop
for( j = 0; j <= 39 ; j++)
{ /*Do something to each line*/}.

So far so good. My problem is that i define the size of the array lines
for the a text file that has 40 lines. I tried to count the lines and then define the size but I am getting segmentation fault.
My approach:
int count=1 ; char c ;
for (c = getc(in); c != EOF; c = getc(in))
    if (c == '\n') // Increment count if this character is newline
        count = count + 1;
printf("\nNUMBER OF LINES = %d \n",count); 

char* lines[count];

Any ideas ?
