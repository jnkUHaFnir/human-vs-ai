I'm writing a small app that will allow a user to eject (or safely remove) a USB drive. My app works fine, except the situation when a folder on the USB drive (or several folders) are opened in Windows Explorer. In that case the eject function fails as the drive appears to be locked.
So I'm curious, since the user is issuing a command through my app to eject the USB drive, is there any way to make Explorer close those open windows from the USB drive?
PS. Note that I don't want to close all processes belonging to the Windows Explorer, but only the ones that opened folders on a specific drive.
