I'm new to C and trying to write a double linked list for in C. I want to jump out of or return null value if the index out of the linked list counts but not exit the whole program. Just to print the error and return Null or something that user will recognise out of scope. I don't know if C can do it.
Here is part of my code. free_node function is to return data of the node and release the node space. I just want to know what can I do to this pop function that I can deal with out of scope problem. 
Thanks
typedef struct node{
    void *data;
    struct node *next,*prev,*head,*tail;
}Node;

typedef Node *List;

Node pop_node(List plist,long index){
    Node *pnode;
    pnode=direct_to_head(plist)->next;
    if(index>list_count(plist)){
        fprintf(stderr, "index out of link list scope.");
        return;
    }
    while (pnode->next!=NULL && index-->0) {
        pnode=pnode->next;
    }

    return free_node(pnode);
}
