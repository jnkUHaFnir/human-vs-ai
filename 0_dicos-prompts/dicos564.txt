I want to write a program which asks user some input values and gives results according to the input values. The following code works but when I enter "John" only 4 spaces are used in the 100 memory. Other 96 are wasted. Also, there is no guarantee that input will be smaller than 100 characters (very unlikely but possible). Is there a way to optimize this?
P.S: When I researched about it, some sites say I should use sscanf() or fgets() but I didn't understand how to use them in my code.
P.P.S : I am very new to C so please show me the simplest way.
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
     char name[100];
     printf("Your name: \n");
     scanf("%100s", name);
     printf("Name: %s  \n", name);

    return 0;
}
