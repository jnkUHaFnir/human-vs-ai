I am new to this, please forgive me if my question has issues.
I would like to read in an integer, a character array (say size 30), and a floating point number in C. How do I read all of it in one line in C, say 200 Merck 58.9? I have tried using scanf consecutively in the following, but the second scanf is not working - the space between input (e.g. 200 Merck 58.9) is causing mayhem.
printf("Please enter an integer, one word string, and a float in one line");

scanf("%i", &any_integer);

scanf("%29s", &any_string); // no spaces - just a one word string

scanf("%f", &any_float);

I would then like to test what the user enters, ensure that the integer and float is positive and not above 50, and in the string ignore anything that is not a character. Here is a start for the integer.
/* Test the input */

while(any_integer < 0 || any_integer > 50)
{
   printf("\n*** Invalid integer.\n Please enter a value between 1 and 50: 
   ");
   scanf("%i", &any_integer);

}/* end while */

while(any_float < 0)

{
   printf("\n*** Invalid float.\n Please enter a positive value: ");
   scanf("%f", &any_float);

}/* end while */

I would like to put this setup in an infinite while loop that terminates with 999, but i am struggling with the details laid out above.
