I want to make dynamically allocated c-string table, but I think i don't understand the topic very well, could You explain it to me or correct my code?
#include <stdio.h>

    int main()
    {
        int i;
    char** t;
        t=(char**)malloc(16*sizeof(char*));

    for(i<0;i<100;i++)
    {
        *t[i]=(char*)malloc(16*sizeof(char));
    }

    return 0;
    }
