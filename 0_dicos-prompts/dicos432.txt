There is supposedly something wrong (in terms of software security) with this code snippet and i cant seem to figure it out ...The function die terminates the the program after displaying the string argument.
void get_user(char* user)
{
  char buf[1024];
  if (strlen(user) > sizeof(buf))
    die("error: user string too long\n");
  strcpy(buf, user);
  â€¦
} 

-thx!
