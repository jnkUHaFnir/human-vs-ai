Qn) Given only a pointer to a node to be deleted in a singly linked list, how do 
  you delete it? 

I am trying to delete the last element i.e., 1 but the else part goes into an infinite 
loop printing garbage values.
Original link.
int main()
{
    struct Node* head = NULL;
    push(&head, 1);
    push(&head, 4);
    push(&head, 6);
    push(&head, 8);
    print(head);
    del_p(head->next->next->next);
    cout << endl;
    print(head);
    return 0;
}

void del_p(struct Node* current)
{
    struct Node* temp;
    if (current->next != NULL)
    {
        temp = current->next;
        current->data = temp->data;
        current->next = temp->next;
        free(temp);
    }
    else
    {
        free(current);
        current = NULL;
    }
}
