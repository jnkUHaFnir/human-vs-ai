I need to parse strings of four hex characters to an integer. The characters appear inside a longer string, and there are no separators - I just know the offset they can be found in. The hex characters are case insensitive. Example with offset 3:
"foo10a4bar" -> 4260

I'm looking for a snippet that is

Short (too much code always creates complexity)
Simple (simple to understand and verify that it is correct)
Safe (invalid input is detected and signalled, no potential memory problems)

I'm a bit leery of using the 'sscanf' family of functions for this, but if there's a safe ANSI C solution using them, they can be used.
