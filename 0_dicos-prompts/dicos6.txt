I have the following code to read from a file:
fin = fopen("file1.txt", "r");

char* url;
if ( fin ) 
{
    while ( line = read_line(fin) ) 
    {
        if ( (url=strstr(line, "url="))!=NULL )
        {
            fprintf(stdout, "%s \n", url);
            url=line;
        }
        free(line);
    }
}

printf("line is:%s ",url); //this one is NULL. How to solve this? 
                           // I need A COPY OF THE DATA
fclose(fin);

For some reason url is null when printf is called - how do I solve that? I need a copy of the data.
