I have function to check file existing:
int file_exists(char *filename)
{
    struct stat buffer;
    int i = stat(filename, &buffer);
    if (i == 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

and it works fine with full path, but I want to check if file exist in user home directory and if not - in /etc directory. How to do it?
