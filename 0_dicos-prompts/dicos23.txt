I have two equal strings, I need to delete a portion of one of them, and store it in another.
My code is not working:
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char *imagetmp = argv[1];
    char *imagefile = imagetmp;
    char *unpackdir = imagetmp;

    // Remove substring from char imagefile
    char * pch;
    pch = strstr (imagefile,".img");
    strncpy (pch,"",6);

    // Print strings
    puts (imagefile);
    puts (unpackdir);
    return 0;
}

Here is the expected output:
./imgtools mysuperimage.img
mysuperimage.img
mysuperimage

Here is the actual output:
./imgtools mysuperimage.img
mysuperimage
mysuperimage

How can I fix this?
