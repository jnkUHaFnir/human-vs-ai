I am reading a .csv file with:
FILE * fPointer; = fopen(fileName, "r");
char singleLineContent[150];

while(fgets(singleLineContent, 150, fPointer))
{
     /* data handling */
}

It stops reading the file at line 40239. I have no idea why.
Here is the entire file. It returns -1. There are over 1 million lines in the file. I also write another file with this data:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Type the name of a file to be read (30 character max): ");
    char fileName[30];
    scanf("%s", fileName);
    printf("Type the name of destination file (30 character max): ");
    char fileNameW[30];
    scanf("%s", fileNameW);
    FILE * fPointerForWriting = fopen(fileNameW, "w");
    FILE * fPointer;
    fPointer = fopen(fileName, "r");

    int i = 1;
    char singleLineContent[150];

    while(fgets(singleLineContent, 150, fPointer))
    {
        char *token = strtok(singleLineContent, ",\n");
        fprintf(fPointerForWriting, "%d", atoi(token));
        token = strtok(NULL, ",\n");
        fprintf(fPointerForWriting, ",%d     %d\n", atoi(token), i);
        if(token == NULL)
        {
            printf("There are no tokens\n");
            return -3;
        }
        i++;
    }

    fclose(fPointerForWriting);
    fclose(fPointer);

    return 0;
}

It says I need to add more details that are not code. It says I need to add more details that are not code. It says I need to add more details that are not code.
