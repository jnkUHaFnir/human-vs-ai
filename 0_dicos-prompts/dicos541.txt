I have the following input:
((1828,299),(2729,2553),(2797,2929),(2200,1383),(2894,876))

and following struct:
struct x{
int a;
int b;
}

How can I read the input with scanf() to create an array of my structs?
I have tried
scanf("%[^, ()],%d", &arr);
    if (i % 2 == 0){
        arr[i].x = scanf("%d");
    }else
        arr[i].y = scanf("%d");

But when I tried to print these values out I got some strange characters
