this is my firs question on this website. 
I am (desperately) trying to invert a big matrix in my program. 
I would like to use lapack in order to do this, and I found this thread which looks quite promising, but I think it's in C++ language. Could you help me out?
Computing the inverse of a matrix using lapack in C
Thank you.
Update: you are right, the answer is a bit unclear. After incorporating the program i posted into mine, I get the following error:
mymatrixmalloc_2.c:15:18: fatal error: cstdio: non existing File or directory 
#include <cstdio>
              ^
compilation terminated.

I guess the prolem is that I havent's properly installed the llapack library, or that I am including it while compiling. 
This is how I installed the library (from terminal, I have Ubuntu):
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install liblapack*
sudo apt-get install libblas*

And this is how I compile:
davide@John:~$ gcc -Wall -lm -llapack -lblas mymatrixmalloc_2.c -o mymatrixmalloc_2.exe

What am I doing wrong?
