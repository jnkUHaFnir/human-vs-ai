I'm porting some code from Java to C, and so far things have gone well.
However, I have a particular function in Java that makes liberal use of StringBuilder, like this:
StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
// .. build string out of variable-length data
for (SolObject object : this) {
    result.append(object.toString());
}
// .. some parts are conditional
if (freezeCount < 0) result.append("]");
else result.append(")");

I realize SO is not a code translation service, but I'm not asking for anyone to translate the above code.
I'm wondering how to efficiently perform this type of mass string concatenation in C. It's mostly small strings, but each is determined by a condition, so I can't combine them into a simple sprintf call.
How can I reliably do this type of string concatenation?
