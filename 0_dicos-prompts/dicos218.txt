I have been on this fow quite some time now and i dont seem to figure it out. 
I have this code:
    unsigned char *src;
    int length = (parameterArray[i].sizeInBits/8) + 1; // check how long array should be
    unsigned char tmp[length]; // declare array

    memcpy(tmp, (char*)&parameterArray[i].valueU8, length); // in this case copy char to array
    src = realloc(src, strlen(src) + strlen(tmp)); // reallocate space for total string
    strncat(src, tmp, strlen(tmp)); // merge 

every time the code crashes on the reallocating part.
I have tried almost everything and nothing works. Please help
