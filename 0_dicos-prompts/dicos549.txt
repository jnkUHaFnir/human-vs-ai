I am trying to dynamically allocate memory for this C program I have constructed which takes a single string input and reverses it then prints the reversed output. I am very new to C and am unsure on how to use malloc to allocate memory for specified user input. This is the current code I have, we are running these programs in linux, using gcc code.c -o code to compile. Where the file is named code.c
int main(void)
{
    char input[256];
    char temp;
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    scanf("%s", input);
    j = strlen(input) - 1;

    while (i < j)
    {
        temp = input[j];
        input[j] = input[i];
        input[i] = temp;
        i++;
        j--;
    }
    printf("Reverse = %s", input);
    return 0;
}
