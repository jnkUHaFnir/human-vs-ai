This code is printing extra memory garbage instead. How could I fix it?
In this code I'm trying to remove 10% of the price (that will be inserted by the user).  
if (value == 1){
    int price = 0;
    int price_final = (price - (price - 0.01);
    printf ("INSERT A PRICE >> ");
    scanf ("%d", &price);
    printf ("Final value %d", price_final);
}
