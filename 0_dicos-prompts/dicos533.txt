So, I have a program that takes initial arguments from the command line and attempts to see how many times they occur for a given input.
For example in terminal you would write something like this:
./main cat nap dog

Then it would say looking for 3 words and you would input the words, followed by a period when you would like it to end:
Looking for words:
cat
cat
nap
.

The program would then return:
Result:
cat: 2
nap: 1
dog: 0

I want to implement a way so you can input multiple words on one line and it would still count them.
I have the following function:
int process_stream(WordCountEntry entries[], int entry_count)
{
  short line_count = 0;
  char buffer[30];

  while (fgets(buffer, 30, stdin)) {
    buffer[strlen(buffer)-1]='\0';
    char* token = strtok(buffer, " \n");
    while (token != NULL){
      token = strtok(NULL, " \n"); 
      int i = 0;
      while (i < entry_count+1) {
        if (!strcmp(entries[i].word, token))
          entries[i].counter++;
        i++;
      }
      line_count++;
    }
  }
  return line_count;
}

I attempt to tokenize each given string using the delimiter of " " and then try to move on to the next line. However, it only separates the first word and then gives a segmentation fault.
