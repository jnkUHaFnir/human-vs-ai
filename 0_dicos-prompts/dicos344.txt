I've written the following program to read line by line from a file and store it in the words array. The output should be two random words from the array. But surprisingly the words array contains only the last word read repeatedly. Any help on what went wrong? 
int main(){
 int i = 0;
 char line_buffer[BUFSIZ];
 char* words[20];
 FILE *fp = fopen("input.txt", "r");
  while (fgets(line_buffer, sizeof(line_buffer), fp)) {
  //printf("%s", line_buffer); 
  words[i] = line_buffer;
  i = i + 1;
 } 
 printf("%d", i);
 int j = rand()%8;
    int k = (j+1)%8;
 printf("%s %s", words[j], words[k]); 
 fclose(fp);
 return 0;
}
