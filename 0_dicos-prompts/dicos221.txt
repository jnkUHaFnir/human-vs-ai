I am trying to make a function that will allocate memory dynamically while the user hit any key other than ENTER. The code compiles without errors or warnings (on gcc) but is not working properly...could someone tell me what is going wrong exactly?
I got the code to work if I modify the function to return a pointer to char i,e, something like
char * getString(char * string);
However I am still curious about the original code and why is not working, would very much appreciate any explanation. Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void getString(char * string);

int main(void){

    char * str = NULL;

    printf("Write something:\n");
    getString(str);
    printf("You wrote:\n");
    printf("%s\n", str);
    free(str);

    return 0;
}


void getString(char * string){
    char ch;
    int length = 0;

    do{
        scanf("%c", &ch);
        if(length == 0){
            string = (char *) malloc(sizeof(char));
        } else {
            string = (char *) realloc(string, (length + 1) * sizeof(char));
        }
        if(string == NULL){
            printf("ERROR: memory could not be allocated!!\n");
        }

        string[length] = ch;
        length++;
    } while(ch != '\n');

    string[length - 1] = '\0';
}
