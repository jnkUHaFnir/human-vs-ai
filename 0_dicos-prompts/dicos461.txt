I'm trying to remove consecutive repeated characters from a given string.
Example: 

bssdffFdcrrrtttii        ***#   

output is supposed to be:

bsdfFdcrti *#

This code doesn't work and only prints the first char (b), I want to learn about my mistake.
when I'm doing a printf test, it works but not for spaces.
I think the problem might be with the new char array.
void Ex6() {
    char* string[80];
    scanf("%s", &string);
    puts(removeDup(string));
}

char* removeDup(char *string) {
    int i, c = 0;
    char* newString[80];
    for (i = 0; i < strlen(string); i++) {
        if (string[i] != string[i + 1]) {
            newString[c++] = string[i];
        }
    }
    return newString;
}
