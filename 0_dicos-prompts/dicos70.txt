I'm trying to build python-kerberos on AIX.  kerberospw.c uses a call to asprintf, but from what Google is telling me, asprintf does not exist on AIX.
I saw http://www.koders.com/c/fidAA9B130D588302673A28B568430A83131B7734C0.aspx?s=windows.h, which looks like I could create a stand-in asprintf, but I don't know where this would go or how I would #include it in kerberospw.c.
Is there a way I can use the koders.com example or some other code to "fake" asprintf?  Can I just include the asprintf function as shown in kerberospw.c?  I am not a C coder, but   

asprintf (char **resultp, const char *format, ...)  

doesn't look like a valid signature to me with the dots at the end.  The relevant line from kerberospw.c is below  

asprintf(&message, "%.*s: %.*s",
          (int) result_code_string.length,
          (char *) result_code_string.data,
          (int) result_string.length,
          (char *) result_string.data);

I realize I could contact the author of python-kerberos, but a) I think it would be helpful to have a potential patch if I did so, and b) there might be other software I run across that uses asprintf, and it would be nice to have a workaround.
