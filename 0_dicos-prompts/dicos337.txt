The interview question is more complicated, so i simplified it as

input data will be in a format of A,B
A is a number between 0 and 18446744073709551615(mysql bigint)
B is a random string
we will provide IO part 

You should provide two functions in c/c++

set(unsigend long long A, char *B) 
get(unsigend long long A)

data struct and algorithm is up to you.
Requirements

set should be O(1)
get should be O(1)

Put in mind that we might call set 100 million times
Any ideas? I did not give a good answer
my answer was incomplete:
typedef data {
    unsigned long long A;
    char *B;
    data *next;
}

set is just malloc a new data and append to the list
but failed in get part.
