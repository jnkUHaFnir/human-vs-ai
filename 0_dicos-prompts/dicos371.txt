Write a program that takes nouns and
  forms their plurals on the basis of
  these rules:  a. If noun ends in “y”
  remove the “y” and add “ies”  b. If
  noun ends in “s” , “ch”, or “sh”, add 
  “es”  c. In all other cases,  just add
  “s”  Print each noun and its plural. 
  Try the following data:  chair
  dairy    boss    circus  fly   dog 
  church  clue  dish

This is what I've got so far but it just isn't quite functioning like it's supposed to: 
#include<stdlib.h>
#include <Windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#define SIZE    8

char *replace_str(char *str, char *orig, char *rep)
{
    static char buffer[4096];
    char *p;
    if(!(p = strstr(str, orig)))
        return str;
    strncpy(buffer, str, p-str);
    buffer[p-str] = '\0';
    sprintf(buffer+(p-str), "%s%s", rep, p+strlen(orig));
    return buffer;
}

int main(void)
{
    char plural[SIZE];
    printf("Enter a noun: ");
    scanf("%c",&plural);
    bool noreplace = false;

    puts(replace_str(plural, "s","es"));
    puts(replace_str(plural, "sh","es"));
    puts(replace_str(plural, "ch","es"));
    puts(replace_str(plural, "y", "ies"));
    if(noreplace) {
    puts(replace_str(plural, "","s"));
    }
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}

I haven't taken a C class in a while can anyone help me out? 
Thanks.
