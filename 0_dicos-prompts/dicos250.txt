I have a file with millions of lines, each line has 3 floats separated by spaces. It takes a lot of time to read the file, so I tried to read them using memory mapped files only to find out that the problem is not with the speed of IO but with the speed of the parsing.
My current parsing is to take the stream (called file) and do the following
float x,y,z;
file >> x >> y >> z;

Someone in Stack Overflow recommended to use Boost.Spirit but I couldn't find any simple tutorial to explain how to use it.
I'm trying to find a simple and efficient way to parse a line that looks like this:
"134.32 3545.87 3425"

I will really appreciate some help. I wanted to use strtok to split it, but I don't know how to convert strings to floats, and I'm not quite sure it's the best way.
I don't mind if the solution will be Boost or not. I don't mind if it won't be the most efficient solution ever, but I'm sure that it is possible to double the speed.
Thanks in advance.
