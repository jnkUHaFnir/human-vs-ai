    signed int character;

            {
                printf("Error: Out of memory!\n");
                free(temporary);
                free(buffer);
                return 1;
            }
        }
    }
    buffer[length]='\0';
    length-=1;
    while(length>=0)
    {
        printf("%c",buffer[length]);
        length--;
    }
    printf("\n");   
    free(buffer);
    //////////////free(temporary); //( HERE)
    return 0;
}

My program should read a string or a input textfile, store it, and then print it out backwards which is working. I just don't understand why I can't free the temporary value at end.  It's failing with a double free error.
I would like to know why I cant put a free(temporary) where I wrote "here".
If you want to point out another problem in my code i'm happy to learn something.
