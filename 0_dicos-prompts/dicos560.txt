I would like to have the menu print again after the user selects "VIEW" or "BID"..how would I do that without having an infinite loop?? I set up my menu as its own function then called it in my "main" function.
    int menu() {
    char sel[6];

    printf("Welcome to the Silent Auction!\n");
    printf("Please make a selection from the following:\n");
    printf("View Auction [VIEW]\n");
    printf("Bid on Auction [BID]\n");
    printf("Close Auction [CLOSE]\n");

return;
    }


    menu();
    char sel[6];
    scanf("%s", &sel);

    do {

            if (strcmp("VIEW", sel) == 0) {
            ...
            }
        if (strcmp("BID", sel) == 0) {
            printf("Which auction would you like to bid on?\n");
            scanf("%d", &choice);
            if ...
    }       else {
                ...
        }    printf("How much would you like to bid?\n");
            scanf("%f", &user_bid);
            if ...
            else
                cur_bid[choice] += user_bid;
            }
        if (strcmp("CLOSE", sel) == 0) {
            for...
        }

        } while (sel != "CLOSE");




    return 0;
    }
