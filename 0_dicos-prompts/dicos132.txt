I wrote a function for inserting a node at the end of a linked list. When I run the program, and when I call this function, the program just stops working. 
Here is the function:
void insert(node **head, int x) {
    node *new = malloc(sizeof(node));
    new->data = x;
    new->next = NULL;

    node *temp = *head;

    while (temp != NULL) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    temp->next = new;
}

Can anyone tell where did it go wrong?
