I was having some problem when trying to add element to dynamic char array in C programming. Here is the expected output:
How many characters do you want to input: 5
Input the string:datas
The string is: datas
Do you want to 1-insert or 2-remove or 3-quit?: 1
What is the character you want to insert: a
Resulting string: adata

I already did those user input part in the main function and here is the code in main where I take in the string input, size and pass them to insert():
printf("How many characters do you want to input: ");
scanf("%d", &n);
str = malloc(n + 1);
printf("Input the string class: ");
scanf("%s", str);

case '1':
    printf("What is the character you want to insert: ");
    scanf(" %c", &input);
    insert(str, input, n);
    break;

And the part where my insert():
void insert(char *str, char input, int n) {
int i;
size_t space = 1;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    str[i] = (char)(input + i);
    space++;                       
    str = realloc(str, space); 
    if (i > 2) {
        break;
    }
}

for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%c", str[i]);
}
}

However, when I tried to print out the string from insert(), let's say I entered 'a' to append to the first element of dynamic array with a size of 5, the result that I am getting is abcd=
I referenced from the stackoverflow thread and I not sure how to fix this. Thanks in advance.
