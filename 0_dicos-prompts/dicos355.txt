Hello there I've been struggling with this problem for some time and after some research on the internet that didn't bear any fruit I decided to ask for some help.
I need to read some integers from a file and from a specific line and then do something with them.
I know this trick for handling strings of characters                                                               
 while(fgets(pointer_to_string, length, "file_name.txt"))
 line++;       /*increment line-integer type- by 1*/

 if(line == your_line) /*do something with the strings at that line*/

I know that 'fgets()' will read everything until it reaches a newline '\n' so that makes it easy,but my problem is a bit different.
I need to read from a file integers, for example:
5
1 78 45 32 2

In my particular case the number on the first line represents the number of integers located on the second line separated by a blank space, so i need to read the first number then create a pointer to an array to which I will allocate memory:
int a[20];
int num; /*number on first line*/
int* p;
p = a;
p = (int*)malloc(num*sizeof(int));

Of course the memory allocation will be done after I read the first number from the file.
So I guess I'd be easier to just show you my struggle:
int main()
{

FILE* file = fopen("files.txt", "r");

int a[20], first_num, j = 0;
int* p = a, line = 1;
while(!feof(file))
{

    if ( line == 1 )
    {


        fscanf(file, "%d", &first_num);
        p = (int*)malloc(first_num*sizeof(int));
    }
    else
    {


        for ( j = 0; j <  first_num; j++)
            fscanf(file, "%d", (p + j));
    }


    line++;

}

for ( j = 0; j < first_num; j++)
{
    printf("\t%d\t", *(p + j));
}
printf("\n%d", first_num);
free(p);

fclose(file);


return 0;
}

Weirdly enough this program actually works for this example ( number of elements on the 1st line and array on the 2nd ) but I have a feeling that it is flawed or at least I can't call it "clean" mostly because I'm not really sure how that loop works I know that 'feof' function is used to reach the end of a file so as long as I'm not there yet it will return a non-zero value and that's why I can memorize the number on the 1st line but I don't know when and how it checks the loop.At first I thought that it does it at the end of every line  so but that would imply that if I were to change the 'else' with:
else if ( line == 2 )

it would still need to work properly, which it doesn't.So I would appreciate some explanations for how that loop actually works.
My guess is that I need a loop in the 'while' to check when I reached the end of a line or something like that but I'm really stuck.
My real question is for how to read integers separated by space from a specific line from a file and not necessarily the example I gave you ( that one is for someone who wouldn't mind helping me out )
