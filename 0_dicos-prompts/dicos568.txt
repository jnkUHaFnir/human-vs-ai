So I have the txt file from which I need to read the number of students written in that file, and because every student is in separate line, it means that I need to read the number of lines in that document. So I need to:

Print all lines from that document
Write the number of lines from that document.

So, I write this:
#include "stdafx.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* Argo[]){

    FILE *student;
    char brst[255];

    student = fopen("student.txt", "r");

    while(what kind of condition to put here?)
    {
        fgetc(brst, 255, (FILE*)student);
        printf("%s\n", brst);
    }

    return 0;
}

Ok, I understand that I can use the same loop for printing and calculating the number of lines, but I can't find any working rule to end the loop. Every rule I tried caused an endless loop. I tried brst != EOF, brst != \0.  So, it works fine and print all elements of the document fine, and then it start printing the last line of document without end. So any suggestions? I need to do this homework in C language, and I am using VS 2012 C++ compiler.
