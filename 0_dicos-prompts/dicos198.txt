I have the following code which is about 7 times faster than inet_addr . I was wondering if there is a way to improve this to make it even faster or if a faster alternative exists.
This code requires that a valid null terminated IPv4 address is supplied with no whitespace, which in my case is always the way, so I optimized for that case. Usually you would have more error checking, but if there is a way to make the following even faster or a faster alternative exists I would really appreciate it.
UINT32 GetIP(const char *p)
{
    UINT32 dwIP=0,dwIP_Part=0;
    while(true)
    {
        if(p[0] == 0)
        {
            dwIP = (dwIP << 8) | dwIP_Part;
            break;
        }
        if(p[0]=='.') 
        {       
            dwIP = (dwIP << 8) | dwIP_Part;                     
            dwIP_Part = 0;
           p++;
        }
        dwIP_Part = (dwIP_Part*10)+(p[0]-'0');
        p++;
    }
    return dwIP;
}
