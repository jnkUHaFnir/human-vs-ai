I need to construct a path to a file from two strings. I could use this (not tested, though):
/* DON'T USE THIS CODE! */
/* cmp means component */
char *path_cmp1 = "/Users/john/";
char *path_cmp2 = "foo/bar.txt";
unsigned len = strlen(path_cmp1);
char *path = path_cmp1;
for (int i = 0; i < strlen(path_cmp2); i++) {
  path[len + i] = path_cmp2[i];
}

but this could lead to memory corruption I guess. Is there a better way to do this, or is there a function for this in the standard library?
