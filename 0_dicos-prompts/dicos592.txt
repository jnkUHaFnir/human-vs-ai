I have modified an existing code from `

https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/examples/lexicographical-order

The modification is done to read from existing pointer to array. However, I kept getting signs output. https://i.stack.imgur.com/iqWBb.jpg
    char *s1, *st1;
    int i, j;
    char arr[10][10], temp[50];

        s1 = strtok(str1, ";");
        do
        {
            st7 = strstr(s1, "s__");
            if (st7 != NULL)
            {
                for (i = 0;i < 10; ++i)
                {
                    for (j = i + 1; st7[j] < 10; ++j)
                    {                           
                        if(strcmp(arr[st7[i]], arr[st7[j]]) > 0)
                        {
                            strcpy(temp, arr[st7[i]]);
                            strcpy(arr[st7[i]], arr[st7[j]]);
                            strcpy(arr[st7[j]], temp);
                        }                           
                    }
                }
                printf("%s\n", arr[i]);     
            }           
        } while (s1 = strtok(NULL, ";"));

s1: To separate the strings
st7: To select the substring from the string (main result)
str1: It is initialized via the substring of the main file(which I used fopen) The result contain names starting with eg: k__hi, s__bye
The modification is done to organise the strings in dictionary order while getting the strings from st7[selected substrings from a string(s1)].
Please advise as I am new to c programming :)
