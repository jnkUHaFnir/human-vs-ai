I have written a program employing the following concept: 
I create an integer x pass by address to a function, along with a filename, said function opens file if available, scans the first line and sets the value that pX points to equal to the scanned line. 
Only it's not working, and I don't see what I'm doing wrong. As far as I can tell the code below is generally how one would accomplish it, but I'm not sure if I'm not using scanf() correctly with the pointer or what.
void foo() {
    char input[20] = "test.txt";
    int x = 1;
    bar(input, &x);
}

void bar(char *fileName, int *pX) {
    FILE *fp = fopen(fileName, "r");
    char *buffer = malloc(15 * sizeof(int));
    fgets(buffer, 15, fp);
    scanf(buffer, "%d", *pX);
    free(buffer);
    fclose(fp);
}
