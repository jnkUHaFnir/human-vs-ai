I am trying to get a full sentence eg. "This is a sentence." to be stored in the global variable string named 'global'. It will then print out the sentence back out. However after entering my input, I can only get the first word of the sentence printed (This). Anyone got any ideas? 
#include <string.h>

char** global;

int main () {

    printf("Please Enter Text: \n");
    scanf("%s", &global);

    printf("%s", &global);


    return 0;
}
