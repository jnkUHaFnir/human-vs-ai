Does someone know a wrapper which would allow SQLite to load its data from an std::iostream?
To be more explicit:
std::fstream dataStream("database.sqlite");
...
sqlite3_open(...something using dataStream...);

I want to use streams because of their modularity: being able to load a file while it is still being downloaded from the network, decompressing data on-the-fly, etc.
It should be possible by using sqlite3_open_v2 after registering your own VFS. After one hour of implementing (badly-documented) functions, my first attempts got me a weird "out of memory" error from SQLite, and I thought I would ask here if someone knows an existing implementation before spending hours debugging mine.
