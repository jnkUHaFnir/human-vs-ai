For my program I have to make sure the user only inputs a positive INTEGER.   for example if the user inputted 12hi it should not run the program and print to std error.  I am not quite sure how to implement this.
int main(int argc, char *argv[])   
{ 
    if(atoi(argv[1]) < 1)
    {
        cerr << "ERROR!"<< endl;
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
