I'm trying to create a function to read a single line from a file of text using fgets() and store it in a dynamically allocating char* using malloc()but I am unsure as to how to use realloc() since I do not know the length of this single line of text and do not want to just guess a magic number for the maximum size that this line could possibly be.
#include "stdio.h"
#include "stdlib.h"
#define INIT_SIZE 50

void get_line (char* filename)

    char* text;
    FILE* file = fopen(filename,"r");

    text = malloc(sizeof(char) * INIT_SIZE);

    fgets(text, INIT_SIZE, file);

    //How do I realloc memory here if the text array is full but fgets
    //has not reach an EOF or \n yet.

    printf(The text was %s\n", text);

    free(text);

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    get_line(argv[1]);
}

I am planning on doing other things with the line of text but for sake of keeping this simple, I have just printed it and then freed the memory.
Also: The main function is initiated by using the filename as the first command line argument.
