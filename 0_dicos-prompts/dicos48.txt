i have a file needed to be read by code. The file is shown as below. The very ﬁrst line of the ﬁle contains a single integer, indicating the number of journal entries in the ﬁle. I need to write a C program to read a ﬁle and store the contents in a dynamically-allocated array of structs.

I was able to strtok() the day, month and year to store in my struct, however I am stuck in saving the strings to my structs.
Here is my code for strtok(),
FILE* file=fopen("struct.txt","r");
        if (file==NULL){
            perror("Error opening file\n.");}
            else {
                fscanf(file,"%d",&size);
                 res=(Diary*)malloc(size*sizeof(Diary));
                 fscanf(file,"%*[^\n]");
while(fgets(day,1024,file)!= NULL){
    oken=strtok(day,"/");
    h[i]=atoi(oken);          */h[i] is my day
    oken=strtok(NULL,"/");
    fre[i]=atoi(oken);        */fre[i] is the month
    oken=strtok(NULL,"/");
    re[i]=atoi(oken);          */ re[i] is the year
    okena=strtok(day,"\n");
    strcpy(rese[i],okena);    */i had declared rese as char rese[1024]
    printf("%s",okena);
    i++;
   }

the program is not working with that strcpy(), when i run it, it keep crashing. However if i remove the strcpy(), it will print as follow:

which this is not the strings i want to store in my struct as well. I am stuck in how to store the strings into a struct. My struct is 
typedef struct journal{
int day;
int month;
int year;
char entry[1024];
} Diary;

Any good souls could tell me what is wrong?
