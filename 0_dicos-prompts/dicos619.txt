I am a beginner coder and writing a code that

asks for the user's name
check if the length is >15, if it is, it will ask the user to input a shorter name when they restart the program
if the length is valid, upper case the first letter of the entered name
display something like "Hi name"

However, The program keeps exiting no matter what I enter. Here is what I did :
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <conio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char str_name[15];

    printf("Please enter your first name to begin: ");
    scanf_s("%14s", str_name, _countof(str_name));
    getchar();
    
    if (strlen(str_name) > 15)
    {
        printf("The entered name is too long, please restart the program and try again.");
        getchar();
        exit(0);
    }
    else
    {
        str_name[0] = toupper(str_name[0]);

        printf("Hi %s.\n", str_name);
        getchar();
    }
    
    return 0;
}
