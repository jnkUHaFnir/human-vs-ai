I am using GCC compiler
I wanted to scan white character as well so I used scanf("%[^\n]s",&name) and it just worked fine.
say the code is
void main(){
    char name[20];
    scanf("%[^\n]s",&name);
    printf("%s",name);
}

but when i tried to use it with a structure variable the statement doesnt work anymore.
struct book { char name[20];};
main(){
    struct book buk[10];
    int i;
    for(i=0;i<3;i++)
    {
        printf("Enter name of book %d",i+1);
        scanf("%[^\n]s",&buk[i].name);}
    }

The scanf statement just don't execute.
But if I use simple scanf("%s",&name); it works just fine.
Can someone please help me with this?
