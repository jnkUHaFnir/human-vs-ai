#include <cstring>

char* str0;
const char* str1 = "abc";


// assign str1 to str0
strcpy(str0, str1);    // syntax correct, but run time error
str0 = str1;           // syntax error, cannot convert const char* to char*
string n_str = str1;
str0 = n_str;          // syntax error, cannot convert ...


cout << str0 << endl;  // expected output: abc

I'd like to make str0 same as str1 while runtime(after compilation), I don't know how to do it. And for the case str0 = str1; I don't understand why it won't work, because str0 points to nothing, while str1 points to a const string literal, so if I now make str0 point to what str1 is pointing to, it should be fine, but it is not. So it there any way to solve it?
