I am writing a program that streams words from a text file and puts them into an array. I've also added a display of array data to see if everything is ok but I get a segmentation fault after compiling. 
I am new to system programming so I am aware I might have done some basic mistakes. Please find the code below and tell me where have I gone wrong. 
#include <stdio.h>

#define BUFFER 100

int main() {
    char tab[BUFFER];
    FILE *wp;
    wp = fopen("tab_file_b_words.txt", "r");
    if(wp == NULL)
    {
        printf("error/n");
        return -1;
    }
    int i;
    for(i=0; i<sizeof(wp); i++) {
        if(wp != NULL)
            fscanf(wp, "%s", &tab[i]);
        else 
            break;
        }
    printf("Content: \n");
    for(i = 0; i < BUFFER; i++) {
        if(tab[i] != NULL)
            printf("%s\n", tab[i]);
        else 
            break;
        }
    fclose(wp);
    return 0;
}
