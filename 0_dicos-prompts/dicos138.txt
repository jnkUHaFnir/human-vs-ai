I am trying to make a function that input an unknown length of a string , but I don't want it to return anything I want it to make changes by using the pointer that I pass.
this was my attempt .
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void get(char * string){

    int size=1;
    string = malloc(size);
    char c;
    int i=0;    

    while(1){
        c = getchar();
        if(c=='\n'){break;}
        string[i] = c;
        i++;
        string = realloc(string , ++size);
    }

    string[i] = '\0';

}

int main(){

    char *buff;

    printf("String :");
    get(buff);
    printf("%s" , buff);


    return 0;
}

the output on my gcc windows os :
PE

1- what is the PE
2- what is wrong here
3- is the c=='\n' line good for the test if the user pressed an enter or should i use EOF or something else
