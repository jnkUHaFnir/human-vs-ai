using a simple code:
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, int **argv)
{
    int A, B, C, D, E, F; 
    printf ("input 1  : ");
    scanf ("%d", &A);
    printf ("input 2 : ");
    scanf ("%d", &B);
    C = A + B;
    D = A - B;
    E = A * B;
    F = A / B;
    printf ("sum  : %d\n", C);
    printf ("difference : %d\n", D);
    printf ("product  : %d\n", E);
    printf ("quotient : %d\n", F);
    return 0;
}

My question is as such, in the first scanf [p.s I know I can use other input methods its for a project] if you input a float/double number such as 1.3 or 20.5
the sum and difference are quite random for me,anyone can explain to me why the results are what they are?
