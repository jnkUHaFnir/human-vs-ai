I am trying to read integers from a file one by one, and read it into the program as a row & column number.
My file contents are:
3
2 1
2 2
2 3

And my code:
fgets(line, 2, fp);
livecells = atoi(line);
fprintf(stderr, "\n%i live cells\n", livecells);    

while ( !feof(fp) ) 
{
  fgets(line, 5, fp);

  alive_row = atoi(&line[0]);
  alive_column = atoi(&line[2]);

  fprintf(stderr, "\n Cell: (%i)(%i)", alive_row, alive_column);       
}

where line is the character array (string) where the fgets contents are stored, and alive_row, & alive_column are integers.
But for some reason the output is:
3 live cells

 Cell: (0)(0)
 Cell: (2)(1)
 Cell: (2)(2)
 Cell: (2)(3)
 Cell: (2)(3)

The problem is, why is the first cell printed out (0)(0)? I don't know why this is being printed out... Apologies if it is blindingly obvious... 
EDIT: And obviously the repeated cell (2)(3) at the end, oops.
