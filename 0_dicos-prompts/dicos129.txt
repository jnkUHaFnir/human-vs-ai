Please tell me what am I doing wrong here. What I want to do is this:
1.Having txt file with four numbers and each of this numbers has 15 digits:    
std::ifstream file("numbers.txt",std::ios::binary);

I'm trying to read those numbers into my array:  
  char num[4][15];

And what I'm thinking I'm doing is: for as long as you don't reach end of files write every line (max 15 chars, ending at '\n') into num[lines]. But this somewhat doesn't work. Firstly it reads correctly only first number, rest is just "" (empty string) and secondly file.eof() doesn't seems to work correctly either. In txt file which I'm presenting below this code I reached lines equal 156. What's going on?
                for (unsigned lines = 0; !file.eof(); ++lines)
                {
                    file.getline(num[lines],15,'\n');  
                }

So the whole "routine" looks like this:  
int main()
{
std::ifstream file("numbers.txt",std::ios::binary);

char numbers[4][15];

            for (unsigned lines = 0; !file.eof(); ++lines)
            {
                file.getline(numbers[lines],15,'\n');// sizeof(numbers[0])
            }
}

This is contents of my txt file:
111111111111111
222222222222222
333333333333333
444444444444444
P.S.
I'm using VS2010 sp1
