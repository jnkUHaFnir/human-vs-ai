I am working on an exercise which asks me to:

read 20 words from the user,
save them on pointers array depending on their size with memory,
allocation.
find the frequency of the letters,
print them out on histogram.

Step 1 and 2 work fine on my code. The problem is on the frequency. I have placed a testing printf to see if it's working and it comes out that it doesn't count the chars.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define N         20
#define MAX_SIZE  200

int main() {
    char *words[N];
    int i, c = 0, length;
    char *temp;
    int freq[26] = { 0 };

    temp = (char *)malloc(MAX_SIZE * sizeof(char));

    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        printf("Give a word:");
        gets(temp);
        length = strlen(temp);
        *(words + i) = (char *)malloc((length + 1) * sizeof(char));
        strcpy(*(words + i), temp);
        printf("%s\n", *(words + i));
    }
    free(temp);

    while (*words[c] != '\0' && c < 20) {
        if ((*words[c] >= 'a' && *words[c] <= 'z') || (*words[c] >= 'A' &&  *words[c] <= 'Z')) {                    
            freq[*words[c] - 'a']++;
            words[c]++;
        }
        c++;
    }

    for (i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        printf("%c occurs %d times in the entered string.\n", i + 'a', freq[c]);
    }
    return 0;
}
