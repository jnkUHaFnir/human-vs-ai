I'm a beginner in C and I don't understand why my code isn't working. The aim is simply just to reverse a string.
char word[20];
int i, len;

printf("Enter word: ");
    scanf("%s", &word);

len = strlen(word);

printf("String reversed: "); 
for (i = len-1; i >= 0; i--){
    printf("%s", word[i]);
}
