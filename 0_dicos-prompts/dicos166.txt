#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main(){

string m;
int n;

cout << "How many elements would you like to sort?" << endl;

cin >> n;  //index for the array



cout << "Enter " << n << " numbers seperated by a comma to be sorted" <<   endl;

cin >> m;

string unsortedNumbers[n]={m};  // values inputed stored as array values
cout << m << endl;

std::sort(m.begin() , m.end());  //sorting string m
std::cout<< m << endl;

}

I understand that the code is wrong, if you run the code the 'string' works properly until sorting. When sorting numbers above 10 it breaks them down as 1 and 0. Also all the commas get sorted and say your input was 2,3,4,5 your output will look something like ,,,,2345. So my question is how can I let the user select the index size while then allowing whatever number they input to determine the number of variables to then be sorted?
