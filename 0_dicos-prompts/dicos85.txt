I did this program to reverse the order of the words in the give string. (And it works)
i.e. Output: sentence first the is This
However I am stuck when it comes to adding another sentence to the array.
For example I need to have an array {"This is the first sentence", "And this is the second"} producing as output: sentence first the is This , second the is this And
int main() {

    char str[] = {"This is the first sentence"};
    int length = strlen(str);

    // Traverse string from end
    int i;
    for (i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (str[i] == ' ') {

    // putting the NULL character at the position of space characters for 
    next iteration.
        str[i] = '\0';

        // Start from next character
        printf("%s ", &(str[i]) + 1);
        }
}

    // printing the last word
    printf("%s", str);

    return 0;
}

I am new to C so its not surprising that I got stuck even if the solution is quite easy. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!
