I am comparing two strings each coming from arrays.
while(countX<10){
    if(strcmp(scanWord[countX], currentWord[countX]) == 0)
        {scoreCurrent++;scoreCurrent++;}
    countX++;
}

"scanWord[countX]" and "currentWord[countX]" don't compare; each time coming up that they aren't the same even if they are. It works if I compare things that aren't those and I have printed them to screen to check too. They just don't seem to play well. Thanks in advance.
