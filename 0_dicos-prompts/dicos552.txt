I want to search the structure (and print other details of book) I have added for the book for a particular issueNumber entered by user in the .txt file.
When I run the code it terminates after asking for user input (issueNumber-issuenumber).
I don't understand the issue behind this, I think there there is some issue with the while loop (code inside it).
Also I am not finding any good resource on file handling on the internet (maybe only for text mode). It would be helpful if someone suggest good resource.
Below is my code for searching for issueNumber and printing other details too.
My structure:
struct data
{
    char author[25];
    int issueNumber;
    char title[25];
    int issued;
};

My search function:
void searchBookByIssueNumber(FILE *fp)
{
    struct data data2;
    data2.issued = 0;
    int issuenumber = 0;
    printf("enter issue no.");

    scanf("%d", &issuenumber);

    while (fscanf(fp, "%s %d %s %d\n", data2.author, &data2.issueNumber, data2.title, &data2.issued) != EOF)
    {

        if (data2.issueNumber == issuenumber)
        {
            fseek(fp, -5, SEEK_CUR);
            printf("%s %d %s", data2.author, data2.issueNumber, data2.title);
        }
    }
    fclose(fp);
}

Start function:
void start(FILE *fp)
{
    printf("---------------------------------------------------\n");
    printf("|                                                 |\n");
    printf("|      WELCOME TO LIBRARY MANAGEMENT              |\n");
    printf("|                                                 |\n");
    printf("---------------------------------------------------\n");

    /*login();*/
    /*addBook(fp);*/
    searchBookByIssueNumber(fp);
}

Main function:
int main()
{
    FILE *fp;
    fp = fopen("c1.txt", "w+");
    start(fp);

    return 0;
}
