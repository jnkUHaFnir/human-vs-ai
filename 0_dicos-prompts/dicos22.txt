I need to make an array of strings for a program in one of my CS classes.  We are to just assume that the length of all the strings is no more than 50 (this accounts for the null character).
I need use malloc() or calloc() to allocate the proper amount of memory for the array, but I am new to C and I don't really know how to use those functions.
The real question I guess is how much memory to I need do allocate for an array of x strings of 50 characters.
