I'm using fgetc and fopen to read a file in C. I'd like to get the first line in a variable and a second line in a separate variable like so:
f = fopen("textfile", "r");

if (!f) {
   printf("error");
} else {
   loop until end of newline and save entire line to a variable
   1st line ==> line1
   2nd line ==> line2
}

So if textfile has:
hello world
goodbye world

line1 = "hello world"
line2 = "goodbye world"
I'm thinking of looping until a \n but how should I store the characters? Think this is a simple question and maybe I'm missing something?
