I'm making a program in which i ask for the username name, and i'd like to only accept strings with valid characters only (alphabetic).
I found that i can either use
    do{
       //since scanf returns the number of currectly input
       if(scanf("%s", &name) == 1)
           break;
       else printf("Please enter a valid name.\n);
    }while(1);

or
    do{
       check = 0;
       scanf("%s", &name);
       for(i=0; i<strlen(name; i++){
          //since isalpha() returns != 0 if it's a letter
          if(isalpha(name[i]) == 0){
             printf("Invalid character. Please enter a valid name.\n");
             check = 1;
             break;
          }
       }
    }while(check == 1);

But i'm not sure if any of those work, and what would be better to check if there isn't anything except alphabetic letters.
Also though about making all input letters (after this verification) on lower case and make the first letter upper case with
    //all to lower except the first letter
    for(i=1; i<strlen(name); i++){
       name[i] = tolower(name[i]);
    }
    //first letter to upper
    name[0] = toupper(name[i]);
    x=1;
    while(name[x] != '\0'){
       //if the letter before is a white space, even the first letter, it should place the first letter of a name upper
       if(name[x-1] == ' ')
          name[x] = toupper(name[x]);
       x++;
    }

Would this work?
