I have this struct.  
Struct Wizard{
 char name[50];
 int maxHealth;
 int attackMin, attackRange;
 int curHealth, winCount;
};

And I need to make a function save the stats to a txt file.
I was given this bit of code to start it.
int saveWiz(struct Wizard * wiz)
{
  File * fp = fopen("champion.txt","w");
  char * buff = malloc(100);
  sprintf(buff,... );
  sprintf(buff,...);
  //Todo: replace ... with appropriate string, using tags like %d for variables
  fputs(buff,fp);
  fclose(fp);
}

Any help would be much appreciated. I think I am supposed to use the wiz pointer to access the struct but I'm not exactly sure.
