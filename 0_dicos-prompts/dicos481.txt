I'm a Python veteran, but haven't dabbled much in C. After half a day of not finding anything on the internet that works for me, I thought I would ask here and get the help I need.
What I want to do is write a simple C function that accepts a string and returns a different string. I plan to bind this function in several languages (Java, Obj-C, Python, etc.) so I think it has to be pure C?
Here's what I have so far. Notice I get a segfault when trying to retrieve the value in Python.
hello.c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

const char* hello(char* name) {
    static char greeting[100] = "Hello, ";
    strcat(greeting, name);
    strcat(greeting, "!\n");
    printf("%s\n", greeting);
    return greeting;
}

main.py
import ctypes
hello = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary('./hello.so')
name = "Frank"
c_name = ctypes.c_char_p(name)
foo = hello.hello(c_name)
print c_name.value # this comes back fine
print ctypes.c_char_p(foo).value # segfault

I've read that the segfault is caused by C releasing the memory that was initially allocated for the returned string. Maybe I'm just barking up the wrong tree?
What's the proper way to accomplish what I want?
