I am working on a simple C program which is to create a loop of a structure.
So I have a structure of a Students with name, age, and grade.
So the output will be something like this:
Enter name of student 1:
Enter age of student 1:
Enter Grade of student 1:

Enter name of student 2:
Enter age of student 2:
Enter Grade of student 2:

But after I input the grade of Student 1, it skipped The name of student 2 so I got this instead:
Enter name of student 1:
Enter age of student 1:
Enter Grade of student 1:

Enter name of student 2: Enter age of student 2:


And I am using DevC++, here is my code:
#include <stdio.h>

struct student {
    char name[50];   // declare name using array
    int age;
    int grade;
};

int main ()
{
    struct student info[3];   //declare 3 students [3]
    int i;

    for(i=1;i<=3;i++) {    // this is for the looping, student 1, student 2, student 3
        printf("Enter name for student %d : ",i);
        scanf("%s",info[i].name);   // called struct using "." (dot)
        printf("Enter age for sudent %d : ",i);
        scanf("%d",&info[i].age);
        printf("Enter grade for student %d : ",i);
        scanf("%d",&info[i].grade);
    }
    return 0;

}

Can someone find what is wrong with my code? or please help a suggestion to solve this problem to get the expected result.
