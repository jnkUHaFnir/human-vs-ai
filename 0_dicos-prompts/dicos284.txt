I've been trying different solutions but am not sure where to look for the solution.
I prompt the user for "plaintext" and whatever their input is, the chars in their input need to be rotated alphabetically by a number (aka the key) which they provide.
For example: plaintext: HELLO would spit out ciphertext: IFMMP if the key were 1.
Assuming the key will always be a number, here is what my code looks like which attempts to rotate each char by Key: 1. I'm a real noob so please break it down is possible.


{
     string s = get_string("plaintext: ");                                    
     printf("ciphertext: %s\n", s + 1);
}   



The remaining code (which includes identifying and filtering out the key is:


#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, string argv[])
{                
    int counter = 0;    
    if (argc == 2)
    {
        for(int k = 0; k <strlen(argv[1]); k++)
        {
            if (isdigit(argv[1][k]))
            {
                counter++;         
            }
        }   
        if (strlen(argv[1]) == counter)
        {
            string s = get_string("plaintext: ");
            if(s)
            {
                
                printf("ciphertext: %s\n", s + 1);
                free(s);
            }
        }   
        else
        {
            printf("Usage: ./caesar key\n");
        }
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Usage: ./caesar key\n");
    }                     

}



Any assistance would be appreciated.
