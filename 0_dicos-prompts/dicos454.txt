void verification() {
    char pass[50];

    printf(" Enter Password : ");
    fgets(pass, 50, stdin);

    if (pass != 'aaanc6400') {   \\ Warning message in here
        printf("\n Invalid Password.. Please enter the correct password. \n\n");
        verification();
    }
    info();
}

When I compile the program, on the marked line it shows warning that "Character constant too long for its type" and also "Comparison between pointer and integer". And then when I run the code and enter the correct password, it still prints that the password is wrong. What am I doing wrong?
