I'm dealing with small text files that i want to read into a buffer while i process them, so i've come up with the following code:
...
char source[1000000];

FILE *fp = fopen("TheFile.txt", "r");
if(fp != NULL)
{
    while((symbol = getc(fp)) != EOF)
    {
        strcat(source, &symbol);
    }
    fclose(fp);
}
...

Is this the correct way of putting the contents of the file into the buffer or am i abusing strcat()?
I then iterate through the buffer thus:
for(int x = 0; (c = source[x]) != '\0'; x++)
{
    //Process chars
}
