#include<stdio.h>
#include<ctype.h>
int main()
{
    int number, sum = 0;

    // loop body is executed at least once
    do
    {
        printf("Enter a number: ");
        scanf("%d", &number);
        sum += number;
    }
    while(number != 0);

    printf("Sum = %d",sum);

}

This code was supposed to print the sum of all the integers entered by the user. But when the user enters a letter as an input, instead of throwing an error, it was going into an infinite loop, printing the "enter a number" statement but not running any other statement in the loop.
Can someone tell me why this happens?
