I'm a bit new to malloc and C in general. I wanted to know how I can, if needed, extend the size of an otherwise fixed-size array with malloc.
Example:
#define SIZE 1000
struct mystruct
{
  int a;
  int b;
  char c;
};
mystruct myarray[ SIZE ];
int myarrayMaxSize = SIZE;
....
if ( i > myarrayMaxSize )
{
   // malloc another SIZE (1000) elements
   myarrayMaxSize += SIZE;
}


The above example should make clear what I want to accomplish.

(By the way: I need this for an interpreter I write: Work with a fixed amount of variables and in case more are needed, just allocate them dynamically)
