#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Your LAPACK code goes here
    return 0;
}

Make sure that the LAPACK library is properly installed on your system and the compiler knows where to find it. If the error persists, you may need to check the LAPACK installation path and update your command accordingly.

Let me know if this helps to compile your program successfully.
