This example creates a custom VFS using the sqlite3_vfs structure and registers it with SQLite using sqlite3_vfs_register. The custom VFS includes methods (such as iostreamRead and iostreamFileSize) that handle reading data from the std::iostream.

This implementation provides a starting point for using streams to load data into SQLite. You can further refine and customize the custom VFS to suit your specific needs and handle error cases as necessary.
