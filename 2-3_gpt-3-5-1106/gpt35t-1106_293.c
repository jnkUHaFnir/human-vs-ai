In this code, we use the `strcmp` function from the `<string.h>` library to compare the input color with the predefined values for green and red. If the input matches one of the colors, the corresponding value is assigned to the `value` variable. If the input does not match any of the predefined colors, an error message is displayed and the program exits with an error code.
