#include <string.h>

int are_overlapping(const char *a, const char *b) {
    size_t len_a = strlen(a);
    size_t len_b = strlen(b);
    
    // Check if the memory regions overlap without comparing content
    return (a <= b && b < a + len_a) || (b <= a && a < b + len_b);
}
``` 

In this corrected version, we calculate the lengths of both strings separately before comparing the memory addresses for potential overlap. This avoids undefined behavior and provides a portable solution for checking memory overlap.
