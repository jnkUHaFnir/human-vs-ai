By adding `-llapack -lblas` at the end of your compilation command, you are telling the compiler to link against the lapack and blas libraries which are required for lapack functions.

Make sure you have the lapack and blas libraries installed properly on your system as you mentioned in your installation steps. If you continue to face issues, you may need to ensure that the lapack library files are in the expected path or provide the path to the libraries explicitly in the compilation command.
