This code defines two functions: `get_single_char()` and `handle_multiple_chars()`. The `get_single_char()` function prompts the user to enter a single character. If the input is longer than one character, it calls the `handle_multiple_chars()` function which simply displays a message and exits the program. Otherwise, it continues with the rest of the program.

You can further expand and customize this code based on your specific requirements.
