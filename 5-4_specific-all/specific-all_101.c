In this example:
- The `thunk_func` function sets up the passed arguments in registers RDI, RSI, RDX, etc., and then calls the target function whose address is passed as the last argument.
- Remember that the order of argument passing and register usage may vary based on the calling convention.
- You may need to adjust the stack offsets for arguments based on the number and size of arguments passed.

For x86, you would use a different set of registers (like EAX, ECX, EDX) for argument passing due to the 32-bit architecture.

Remember to adjust the code based on the calling convention you are using (e.g., cdecl, stdcall, fastcall) and any specific requirements of the target function.
