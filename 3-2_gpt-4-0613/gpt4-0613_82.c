This code simply forms the final complete strings (containing '*FV', the integer number, and '#') directly in the array "data1" and "data2", saving unnecessary copying operations.

We use formatted input to printf() function to formulate our final strings. It inserts the string and BUF in the corresponding placeholders ("%s" and "%03d", respectively) and writes the results directly into the target arrays.

Please note that you need to ensure that the target string array is large enough to handle the total length of the combined string including the null terminator (in this case, the size of "data1" and "data2" is sufficient). If it is not, then it can lead to buffer overflow, which results in undefined behavior.
