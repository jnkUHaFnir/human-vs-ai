This code initialises a variable `t_size` to store the size of your array. `my_array` is dynamically allocated to the appropriate size. The second while loop reads the file line by line and within that a nested loop is at work that processes the line converting strings into integers using `strtol()`.

Note: Confirm your system supports the getline() function because it's not part of the C standard library, but is a POSIX function. If getline() isn't available, you may use fgets() instead.

Moreover, to read a large file more quickly, you can use buffering or memory mapping techniques:

1. Buffering: You can use `setvbuf` to set a buffer for your file stream which can improve the read speed.

2. Memory Mapping: You can use `mmap` to map your file into memory and then you can access your file as if it were in memory, which can significantly improve the read speed when you have a large file. But note, this is platform dependent.

Finally, using multi-threading (if potential concurrent read is allowed) is another solution but it would significantly increase the complexity of your code and may not gain the needed performance improvement.
