Note: In C, we do have to manage the memory manually. Hopefully, you are doing error checking with your memory allocations (i.e., ensure malloc() is not returning NULL) and remember to free() your memory allocations when you are done with them. This code does not handle such situation, please apply appropriate error checking mechanism to it.
