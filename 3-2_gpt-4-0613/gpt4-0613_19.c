In this example, the size of the array is initially defined as 10. `malloc(mystruct.size * sizeof(int));` is used to allocate enough memory to hold `mystruct.size`(10) integers.

Do not forget to check if `malloc` has returned `NULL` - this indicates that the memory allocation has failed.

Also, you always need to `free(mystruct.array);` when you are done using the array to prevent memory leaks. However, this must only be done once the array is no longer needed, as dereferencing freed memory will lead to undefined behavior.
