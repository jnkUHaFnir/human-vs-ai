If there is free memory and malloc still fails randomly, it may be due to memory fragmentation issues, or it could be a problem with Multithreading and malloc() as they are not thread-safe.

Reasons of random return of NULL from malloc could be:

1. **Memory Fragmentation**: Memory fragmentation can cause malloc to fail to allocate memory even if there appears to be free memory in the system. This is because the memory management system requires a single, contiguous block of memory for malloc to succeed. 

2. **Multithreading**: The C library function malloc() is not thread-safe. Using malloc() in multithreaded programs can lead to errors, such as returning NULL or causing memory leaks. Depending on how your program is structured, this could be a potential issue. Ensure you have appropriate thread-safety mechanisms in place when using malloc() in multithreaded programs.

3. **Memory Leaks**: Another potential issue is memory leaks. If you are frequently allocating memory with malloc and not freeing it with free, then you could be slowly eating up memory, leading to eventual failure of malloc. 

4. **Corrupted Heap**: Overwriting the end of a malloced block, or freeing a block of memory more than once, can corrupt the heap, and the result is often random. A common symptom is that you eventually see a call to malloc fail, because the heap is so badly corrupted that malloc can't make sense of it.

To help diagnose issues such as these, consider using a memory profiling tool, or running the program under a debugger that can catch memory errors.

As a best practice:

- Always check if malloc (and realloc, calloc, etc.) returned NULL. 
- Always free what you malloc when you're finished with it.
- Be very careful to not overrun your allocated blocks. 
- Don't use a pointer after you've freed it.
  
Above all, ensure that you are implementing good validation, error checking, and cleanup routines throughout your program.
