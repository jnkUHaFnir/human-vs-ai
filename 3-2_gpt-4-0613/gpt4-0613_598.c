char *buffer = (char*)malloc(sizeof(characters) * 2);
char *buffer = (char*)malloc(n * 2 + 1);
char *convert_to_16(char *characters, int n) {
    char sub_buffer[3];
    char *buffer = (char *)malloc(n * 2 + 1);

    buffer[0] = '\0';  // Ensure the buffer starts as an empty string.

    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        sprintf(sub_buffer, "%02x", (unsigned char)characters[i]);
        strcat(buffer, sub_buffer);
    }

    return buffer;
}

Remember `ctypes` is a low-level FFI (Foreign Function Interface) and treats strings as bytes, so make sure you pass the byte string to the `c_convert_to_16` function from Python.

Finally, your C code could potentially cause a memory leak since you call `malloc` but never `free`. Therefore, you should also add a function to free allocated memory in the shared library, like this:

```c
void my_free(void* ptr) {
    free(ptr);
}
