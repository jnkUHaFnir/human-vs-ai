In this code, `cv_main` and `cv_workers` are condition variables that synchronize the main thread and the worker threads respectively. The worker threads wait on `cv_workers` before doing their work and the main thread waits on `cv_main` after signaling the worker threads.

There are potential race conditions on `ready` and `processed` which can be eliminated by properly locking these variables using a mutex (`cv_m` in this case). A `std::lock_guard` locks the mutex in its constructor and unlocks it in its destructor, which are called when the `{}` block is entered and left. A `std::unique_lock` allows locks to be manually locked and unlocked, and also enables the use of condition variables.

`cv_workers.wait()` waits until `ready` is greater than 0, and `cv_main.wait()` waits until `processed` is true. `--ready` is executed when the condition is met in worker threads, and `processed` is set to false when the condition is met in the main thread. `cv_workers.notify_all()` wakes up all waiting worker threads, and `cv_main.notify_one()` wakes up the waiting main thread. The corresponding condition variables are used in `wait()` and `notify_all()` / `notify_one()` calls.
