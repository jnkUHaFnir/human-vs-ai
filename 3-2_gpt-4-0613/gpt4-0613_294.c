In this code, we're defining a helper function `getColorValue` which takes a color name as an argument (a string), and returns the associated integer value for that color. The `strcmp` function is used to compare strings for equality.
We also made sure to handle the case where the color name is not recognized by printing an error message and returning a non-zero status code from the program.
