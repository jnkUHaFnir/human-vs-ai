I added `+1` to `malloc` and set `list[argc] = NULL;` because a NULL pointer must be at the end of the array as per POSIX exec function requirements. When running execv, the first argument of the array is the command name and the rest of the arguments are options to that command.

However, multitasking with execv() and memory allocations can be tricky due to timing issues. The memory could be freed before or while execv() is still using it. Ideally you should avoid using malloc / free with execv() and similar in a production environment. 

Also note, typically `execv` is used to spawn a new process, so it doesn't return unless an error occurs. So, if there is a problem with the arguments you pass to `execv`, it's more likely that you will get an error return value (and errno will be set), rather than a runtime error like a bad address. Therefore, please make sure your `argv[i]` content as well as your usage of `execv()` is correct.
