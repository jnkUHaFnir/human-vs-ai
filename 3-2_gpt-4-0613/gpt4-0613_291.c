Note: This code uses `isalnum` function to check if each character in the string is either a digit (0 through 9) or a letter (A through Z or a through z). If there is any character that is not a letter or a digit, it will output "Invalid". It stops checking as soon as it finds an invalid character (since there is no need to check the remaining character if a single invalid character is found).
