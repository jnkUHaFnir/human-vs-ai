The differences with the previous code are:
- Changed `int` to `string`
- Adjusted swapping and comparison operations to work with `string`
- Replaced `cout` and `cin` with `std::cout` and `std::cin` since `using namespace std` is now used. 
- Properly initialized dynamic string array with `new string[n]`
