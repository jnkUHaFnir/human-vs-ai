This code lists Explorer windows, but determining **if a window is showing content from your USB** and **safely closing it** requires more:

- To accurately identify if a window is displaying content from your USB, you might dive into shell windows and COM objects to parse the path. That involves interacting with the Shell Application COM object (`Shell.Application`), inspecting every shell window, and matching its location against your USB drive's path.
- To close the window, you may need more than a simple `WM_CLOSE` message due to the potential complexity of an Explorer window (e.g., it might ignore the message or require more sophisticated handling).

This code is a starting point and may require adjustments based on your exact requirements and the specific nuances of how Explorer windows manage their content and respond to close commands programmatically.

Remember, manipulating user windows can lead to data loss (e.g., unsaved changes in open directories) and should be done with clear communication to and consent from the user.
