### Step 3: Ensure ByteBuffer structure is managed by SWIG

For SWIG to manage the lifetime properly, ensure your `ByteBuffer` structure and its usage patterns are well-defined and exposed to SWIG. If `ByteBuffer` is allocated and deallocated within C++ and only passed around in Python, you might want a way to explicitly free its resources (the `dataBuf`) from Python or ensure it's done automatically.

### Managing ByteBuffer lifetime:

**Option 1: Explicit Python call to free resources**

Expose a method to Python to free `dataBuf` when done:

```cpp
struct ByteBuffer {
    int length;
    uint8_t* dataBuf;
    ~ByteBuffer() {
        delete[] dataBuf; // Ensure proper destruction.
    }
    void freeBuffer() {
        delete[] dataBuf;
        dataBuf = nullptr; // Prevents double free.
    }
};

**Option 2: Automate memory management**

Use smart pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr<uint8_t[]>`) in C++ and ensure SWIG understands how to wrap these. This method requires your C++ codebase to support smart pointers and might necessitate additional SWIG directives for proper memory management.

### Important Note:

For both options, you have to ensure compatibility with your existing codebase and possibly adjust the SWIG interface file to correctly marshal data and types between C++ and Python. Sometimes, more nuanced control over memory and object lifetime management between C++ and Python is needed, and this might involve more advanced SWIG features or even revising how resources are allocated and freed in your C++ library.


### Final Notes:
- Testing and validating memory management in both normal and edge-case scenarios is crucial to prevent leaks or crashes.
- The method you choose should align with your overall project architecture and how tightly C++ objects and Python are integrated.

Given the specifics of SWIG and C++ interaction, remember that memory ownership and management are key to preventing leaks. Always ensure the ownership roles (who allocates and who frees memory) are clearly defined and implemented consistently across your C++ and Python code.
