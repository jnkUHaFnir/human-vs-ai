This example uses manual memory management. In modern C++, consider using smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`) to manage memory automatically and safely.

Keep in mind, this is a basic hash table implementation. For production systems, especially with the possibility of managing a large number of entries, enhancements like dynamic resizing, more sophisticated hash functions, and handling of hash collisions efficiently would be necessary.
