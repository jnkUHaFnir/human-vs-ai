### Considerations

- **Stack Alignment**: Especially on x64, ensure the stack is kept aligned on a 16-byte boundary as per conventions.
- **Calling Convention**: Tailor your thunk based on the calling convention of the function you're intercepting.
- **Performance**: This can add significant overhead, particularly if the function(s) being thunked is(are) called frequently.
- **Compatibility**: Assembly code is inherently non-portable. Different strategies may be needed for different architectures or operating systems.

For actual implementations, especially when crossing into more complex scenarios involving many arguments, floating-point operations, or variadic functions, the process can become much more involved and may require a deeper dive into the calling conventions and ABI documentation specific to your environment.
