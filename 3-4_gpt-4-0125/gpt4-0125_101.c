**x64 Architecture (64-bit):**  
On x64, the calling convention changes quite a bit (focusing on Windows and System V ABIs used in Unix-like OSes, where the first four integer or pointer arguments are passed through registers RCX, RDX, R8, and R9 for Windows, and RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9 for System V ABI in UNIX-like systems). Additional arguments beyond these four would then be pushed onto the stack.

Example for Windows calling convention in assembly:
```assembly
; Assuming we want to thunk to void myFunction(int64_t arg1, int64_t arg2)

mov rcx, arg1  ; Move the first argument into rcx
mov rdx, arg2  ; Move the second argument into rdx
call myFunction   ; Call the function
; No stack cleanup necessary in this example,
; since cleanup is part of the callee's responsibilities

**General Notes:**  
- The above examples are simplified; real use cases may involve more complex scenarios, especially for functions with more than four arguments on x64, or when dealing with member functions (methods) in C++, which implicitly pass the `this` pointer as an additional argument.
- Assembly language and the process of thunking require careful consideration of the target architecture and calling convention.
- Thunking is typically implemented at a very low level, either in carefully crafted assembly code or using compiler-specific extensions (intrinsics) that allow for more direct control over register allocation and function calls.

Remember, manipulating stacks and registers must be done with caution, as errors can result in difficult-to-debug crashes (segmentation faults, stack corruption, etc.). Always test thunks comprehensively in all conditions they're intended to be used.
