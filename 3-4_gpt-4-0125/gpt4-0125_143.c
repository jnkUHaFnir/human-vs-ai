Note: This is a simplified and incomplete example. Actual implementation would require the proper conversion from your RGB buffer to YUV420, error handling, and managing the encoded output (NAL units).

For your situation, directly using x264 or FFmpeg libraries in C++ is a technically richer and ultimately more efficient solution that avoids writing intermediate files to disk or dealing with the complexities of pipe synchronization. Still, it requires dealing with native APIs and additional complexity in coding and building your project.
