This script calculates the sums of consecutive elements, reduces the array size by half each iteration, and stores each intermediate state until only one number is left.

### Remember

Regardless of the approach you choose, the key idea is to continually halve your dataset by summing adjacent elements and keep track of intermediate results efficiently, without unnecessary memory overhead or redundant data management complexities. Tailor the approach to the specifics of your problem and the operations you need to perform in each iteration for optimal performance.
