int main() {
    char ch;
    printf("Enter a character: ");
    scanf("%c", &ch);
    clearBuffer(); // Clears input buffer
    
    if(/* condition to check if input leads to the second function */) {
        // Call second function

### General Advice:

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate user inputs to handle scenarios where the input does not meet your expectations.

2. **Clearing the Input Buffer**: For languages like C, it's crucial to clear the input buffer after reading an input to avoid leaving leftover characters.

3. **User Feedback**: Provide clear feedback to the user if their input is not as expected, guiding them to correct it.

4. **Loop Until Correct Input**: Consider using a loop to repeatedly ask for the input until the user provides it in the desired format.

By following these approaches, you can create a more robust input handling mechanism in your program, reducing the likelihood of it breaking due to unexpected inputs.
