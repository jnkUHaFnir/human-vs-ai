In this implementation, `set` operation inserts a new entry into the hash table, and the time complexity is O(1) due to the average-case constant-time lookup of the hash table. The `get` operation also has O(1) time complexity on average because of the efficient key-based lookup of the hash table.

Using a hash table is a common and effective way to achieve O(1) time complexity for both insertions and lookups in scenarios like the one you described.
