Make sure that the LAPACK and BLAS libraries are installed correctly on your system. If you have installed them using `sudo apt-get install liblapack*` and `sudo apt-get install libblas*`, they should be available for linking.

3. Test your LAPACK installation:
You can create a simple test code that uses LAPACK functions to check if the libraries are correctly installed and linked. If the test code compiles and runs without errors, it indicates that LAPACK is set up properly.

After addressing these points, try compiling your code again with the corrected compilation command. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to ask for more help.
